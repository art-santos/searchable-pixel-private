# Voting System - Authentication Required

## Why Authentication is Required

The voting system requires users to be logged in to:
1. **Prevent spam** - One vote per user per platform
2. **Track votes** - Show which platforms you've already voted for
3. **Database integrity** - The `user_id` has a foreign key constraint to `auth.users`

## What You're Seeing

When not logged in:
- **401 Unauthorized** error when trying to vote
- Toast notification: "Sign in required"
- This is the expected behavior!

## How to Test Voting

### Option 1: Log In First (Recommended)
1. Sign in to the application
2. Open Connect Analytics dialog
3. Vote for platforms
4. Votes will be saved and counted

### Option 2: Test Without Voting
The UI already shows mock vote counts (234, 156, etc.) so you can see how it looks:
- Platform list with vote counts
- Upvote buttons (clickable but require auth)
- Green highlight after voting (visible after login)

## What Happens When Logged In

1. **Before voting**: Upvote buttons are clickable
2. **Click vote**: Loading spinner appears
3. **Success**: 
   - Button turns green
   - Count increases
   - Toast shows "Thanks for voting!"
   - Vote is permanently saved

## Database Design

The voting table enforces authentication:
```sql
user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

This ensures data integrity and prevents fake votes.

## Summary

The 401 error is not a bug - it's the voting system correctly requiring authentication. Log in to test the full voting experience!
