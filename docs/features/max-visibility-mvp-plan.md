# MAX Visibility MVP Launch Plan

## üéØ MVP Strategy: Gaps & Opportunities as Primary Analysis

### Current State Assessment
‚úÖ **Well-Implemented Tabs:**
- **Overview** - Score visualization and basic metrics
- **Citations** - Detailed mention tracking with filters/export  
- **Gaps & Opportunities** - Missing/weak opportunity analysis ‚≠ê **MVP FOCUS**
- **AI Insights** - Trends and recommendations

### üöÄ MVP Approach: Simplify & Focus

#### Primary Tab: **Gaps & Opportunities**
This becomes the main "scoring analysis" that explains:
1. **Why you scored what you did**
   - Missing opportunities (0% mention rate)
   - Weak positions (<50% mention rate)
   - Strong positions (>70% mention rate)

2. **Actionable insights for improvement**
   - High-priority content gaps
   - Quick win opportunities  
   - Traffic potential estimates

3. **Content generation feed**
   - Specific questions to target
   - Content type recommendations
   - Priority scoring for content calendar

#### Secondary Tabs (Simplified):
- **Overview** - Keep as dashboard summary
- **Citations** - Rename to "Mentions" for clarity
- **AI Insights** - Merge into Gaps tab or make it MAX-only

## üìä MVP Data Flow

### Input: Assessment Results
```typescript
interface MVPAssessmentData {
  score: {
    overall_score: number
    mention_rate: number
    questions_analyzed: number

  }[]
  next_actions: {
    create_content: string[]

  }
}
```

### Output: Content Generation Feed

  high_priority_topics: {
    topic: string
    content_type: 'blog_post' | 'landing_page' | 'faq' | 'comparison'
    target_queries: string[]

## üö¢ Launch Checklist

### Pre-Launch (MVP Ready)
- [x] Streamline to 3 tabs max (Overview, Citations, Gaps & Opportunities)
- [x] Remove AI Insights tab for MVP focus
- [x] **FIXED: Database data flow issue** - API now returns `topics` array for gaps analysis
- [ ] Add "Generate Content" actions to gaps tab
- [ ] Test with real assessment data
- [ ] User profile setup validation

### Current Status: **CUMULATIVE METRICS IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ

**Issue Found & Fixed:**
- **Problem**: Share of voice only showed single assessment data, not growth over time
- **Root Cause**: API was calculating metrics from latest assessment only
- **Solution**: Implemented cumulative aggregation across ALL completed assessments
- **Additional Features**: Added assessment count display and cumulative performance summary
- **Result**: Share of voice now grows with each scan, showing true market progress

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Before: Single assessment metrics
const shareOfVoice = (userMentionRate / competitorMentionRates) * 100

// After: Cumulative across all assessments
const allAssessments = await supabase.from('max_visibility_runs').select('*').eq('company_id', company.id)
const userCumulativeMentions = allAssessments.reduce((sum, assessment) => sum + assessment.mention_rate, 0)
const competitorAggregates = aggregateCompetitorsByName(allCompetitors)
const cumulativeShareOfVoice = (userCumulativeMentions / totalMarketMentions) * 100
```

**New Cumulative Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Growing Share of Voice**: Metrics increase with each scan
- ‚úÖ **Competitor Aggregation**: Same competitors summed across all assessments
- ‚úÖ **Assessment Count Display**: Shows how many scans contributed to each competitor
- ‚úÖ **Cumulative Performance Panel**: Total scans, mentions, and market share
- ‚úÖ **Progressive Ranking**: Rankings based on cumulative performance

**User Experience:**
- Users see **growing numbers** that feel rewarding
- **Multi-scan users** get cumulative performance summary
- **Competitor tracking** shows who's consistently mentioned
- **Market position** reflects true competitive standing over time

**Example Display:**
```
Cumulative Performance (3 scans)
‚îú‚îÄ Total Scans: 3
‚îú‚îÄ Your Total Mentions: 15.7
‚îî‚îÄ Market Total Mentions: 127.3

Top 10 Competitors (Cumulative across 3 scans)
1. Your Company (15.7 mentions) - 12.3% cumulative share
2. ColdIQ (23.4 mentions ‚Ä¢ 2 scans) - 18.4% cumulative share  
3. Apollo.io (19.1 mentions ‚Ä¢ 3 scans) - 15.0% cumulative share
```

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Test frontend to confirm 10 competitors now display
- [ ] Run new scan to populate competitor scores
- [ ] Verify "Generate Content" actions work with real data

### Launch Features
- [x] **Core MVP tabs**: Overview, Citations, Gaps & Opportunities  
- [x] **Real data flow**: Database ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend components
- [x] **Score explanation**: Clear breakdown in gaps analysis
- [x] **Priority gap identification**: High/medium/low priority opportunities
- [ ] Content generation buttons
- [x] Export functionality (citations tab)
- [x] Simple mention tracking

### Next Steps for MVP Launch
1. **Test the fix**: Verify gaps tab shows real data from completed assessments
2. **Add content generation buttons**: "Generate Content" for each gap
3. **Profile validation**: Ensure users have domain setup
4. **Polish UX**: Smooth the user flow for new vs returning users
