# Split Leads - Marketing & Positioning

## Tagline
**"Turn AI mentions into sales meetings"**

## One-Liner
Split Leads identifies which companies discover you through ChatGPT and Perplexity, then delivers their decision-makers' verified emails for 95% less than Clearbit.

## Elevator Pitch

Every day, ChatGPT and Perplexity recommend your product to potential buyers. But you have no idea who they are.

Split Leads changes that. We track when AI systems send traffic to your site, identify the companies behind those visits, and instantly enrich them with verified decision-maker contacts.

While Clearbit charges $0.20-0.40 per contact with stale data, we deliver fresh leads for under $0.04 using real-time web search. 

**The result?** You can finally measure and monetize your AI visibility.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. AI Attribution (Unique)
- **Only tool** that shows which leads came from ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity
- Turn "mentioned by AI" into a powerful sales trigger
- Prove ROI from AI-optimized content

### 2. 95% Cost Reduction
- **Split**: < $0.04 per lead
- **Clearbit**: $0.20-0.40 per contact
- **Apollo**: $0.15-0.30 per contact
- **RB2B**: $250-1000/mo regardless of volume

### 3. Real-Time Freshness
- Data from live web search, not 6-month-old databases
- Current job titles and company info
- Recent "public signals" for personalization

### 4. Built for Modern B2B
- One-line installation (vs complex integrations)
- Designed for PLG and content-led growth
- Native webhooks for automation

## Target Personas & Messaging

### 1. B2B SaaS Marketers
**Pain**: "I invest in SEO and content but can't track AI-driven pipeline"

**Message**: "Finally prove that your AI mentions drive revenue. See exactly which companies discover you through ChatGPT and reach their decision-makers instantly."

### 2. SDRs/BDRs
**Pain**: "I waste time researching leads and finding emails"

**Message**: "Stop manual prospecting. Get verified emails for every company visiting your site, with context about how AI recommended you."

### 3. Founders/Growth Teams
**Pain**: "Clearbit is too expensive and the data is stale"

**Message**: "Replace your $1000/mo Clearbit bill with $49/mo Split Leads. Fresher data, AI attribution, 95% cheaper."

## Sales Enablement

### Discovery Questions
1. "How do you currently track which companies mention you in AI tools?"
2. "What are you paying for contact enrichment today?"
3. "How quickly can your SDRs act on warm website visitors?"
4. "Would knowing the AI source help personalize outreach?"

### Objection Handling

**"We already have Clearbit"**
→ "Great! How much are you paying? Our customers typically save 90% while getting fresher data plus AI attribution. Want to run a side-by-side comparison?"

**"We don't get AI traffic"**
→ "You might be surprised. Install our free tracking first, and you'll see exactly how many visitors come from ChatGPT and Perplexity. Then decide if enrichment makes sense."

**"$49/mo seems expensive"**
→ "One qualified lead typically results in a meeting worth $500-2000. At $0.04 per lead, you break even with just one booking. Clearbit charges 5-10x more per contact."
