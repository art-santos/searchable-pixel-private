# Crawler Tracking Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The crawler tracking stopped working approximately 3 hours ago. Investigation revealed that while the middleware was detecting AI crawlers, it was only logging them to the console and not actually tracking them in the database.

## Root Cause
The middleware code had this:
```typescript
if (isAiCrawler(ua)) {
  console.log("[AI-CRAWLER]", ua, request.nextUrl.pathname);
}
```

But it was missing the actual tracking implementation to send data to the `/api/crawler-events` endpoint.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- Added `trackCrawlerVisit()` function to send crawler data to the API
- Added `getCrawlerInfo()` to identify specific crawlers (GPTBot, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)
- Added `getSystemApiKey()` to retrieve API key for authentication
- Made tracking non-blocking to avoid impacting page load performance
- Added caching for API key to reduce database lookups

### 2. Created System API Key
- Created a special "System Crawler Tracking" API key for the admin user
- This key is used by the middleware to authenticate with the crawler-events API
- Key is cached for 1 hour to improve performance

### 3. Key Features of the Fix
- **Non-blocking**: Tracking happens asynchronously, doesn't slow down responses
- **Cached API key**: Reduces database queries
- **Fallback support**: Works with both workspace and user API keys
- **Skip API routes**: Prevents infinite loops when tracking API calls
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles failures without breaking the site

## How It Works Now

1. When a request comes in, middleware checks if it's from an AI crawler
2. If yes, it extracts crawler information (name, company, category)
3. Fetches the system API key (cached after first fetch)
4. Sends tracking data to `/api/crawler-events` asynchronously
5. The request continues normally without waiting for tracking to complete

## Crawlers Tracked
- GPTBot (OpenAI)
- ChatGPT-User (OpenAI)
- Claude-Web (Anthropic)
- ClaudeBot (Anthropic)
- PerplexityBot (Perplexity)
- Google-Extended (Google)
- Bingbot (Microsoft)
- FacebookBot (Meta)
- Bytespider (ByteDance)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Check the dashboard to verify crawler visits are being tracked
2. **Add more crawlers**: Update the crawler list as new AI bots emerge
3. **Environment variable**: Consider adding `SPLIT_SYSTEM_API_KEY` to .env for easier configuration
4. **Performance**: Monitor the impact on response times (should be minimal)

## Verification

To verify tracking is working:
1. Check the dashboard for new crawler visits
2. Look for `[CRAWLER-TRACKING]` logs in server output
3. The system should now track all AI crawler visits automatically

The fix is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing functionality. All existing API keys and integrations continue to work as before.
