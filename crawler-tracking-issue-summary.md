# Crawler Tracking Issue Summary

## Problem Identified
Your crawler tracking stopped showing data at 8-10 PM because **crawler visits are being recorded WITHOUT workspace_id**, and the dashboard APIs filter strictly by workspace_id.

### Evidence from Diagnostics:
```
‚úÖ Recent visits WITH workspace_id: None found

‚ùå Recent visits WITHOUT workspace_id:
  - 2025-06-06T05:43:11.601+00:00: www.origamiagents.com (Googlebot)
  - 2025-06-06T05:41:54.936+00:00: www.origamiagents.com (OAI-SearchBot)
  ... (all recent visits)

üìä Hourly counts (last 3 hours):
  9 PM: 0 with workspace, 11 without
  8 PM: 0 with workspace, 18 without  
  7 PM: 7 with workspace, 3 without    ‚Üê Last hour with proper data
```

## Root Cause
The production API is still using the **old validation function** (`validate_api_key`) that doesn't return workspace information:

```
// Your Vercel logs show:
keyData: {
  user_id: 'e0390b8d-f121-4c65-8e63-cb60a2414f97',
  domains: null,
  is_valid: true
}
// Missing: workspace_id and key_type!
```

## Why Charts Show No Data
Both dashboard endpoints strictly filter by workspace_id:
```typescript
// From crawler-visits/route.ts
query = query.eq('workspace_id', workspaceId)

// From crawler-stats/route.ts  
query = query.eq('workspace_id', workspaceId)
```

Since new visits don't have workspace_id, they don't appear in charts.

## Immediate Fix

### 1. Deploy Latest Code to Vercel
Make sure the updated `/api/crawler-events/route.ts` is deployed, which uses:
```typescript
const { data: keyData, error: keyError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .rpc('validate_any_api_key', { p_key_hash: keyHash })
```

### 2. Backfill Missing Workspace IDs
Once deployed, run:
```bash
node backfill-crawler-workspace-ids.js
```

This will:
- Find all crawler visits without workspace_id
- Match them to user's workspaces (by domain when possible)
- Update the database records

## Scripts Created

1. **check-and-fix-crawler-tracking.js** - Diagnostic tool to check database state
2. **backfill-crawler-workspace-ids.js** - Fix existing data by adding workspace IDs
3. **check-recent-crawler-visits.js** - Quick check of recent crawler activity

## Next Steps

1. **Verify deployment** - Check that your latest code is deployed to Vercel
2. **Run backfill** - Fix existing data: `node backfill-crawler-workspace-ids.js`
3. **Monitor** - New visits should start appearing with workspace_id immediately

The issue appears to be a deployment lag - your code is updated but production is still running the old version.
