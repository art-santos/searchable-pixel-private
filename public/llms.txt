# Split.dev: The Attribution Infrastructure for LLM-Powered Search

Split.dev is the first visibility and attribution platform designed specifically for the LLM era—tracking AI crawler activity, simulating model queries, and attributing citations back to traffic and conversion.

It’s like **Segment + Clearbit for LLMs**: instrumentation to track AI interactions, plus identity-layer attribution to understand who’s engaging because of those interactions.

It’s also like **RB2B, but for AI traffic**: Split doesn’t just show you bot hits—it reveals which LLMs discovered you, what they cited, and how that led to real user sessions.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Crawler Tracking**
   - Lightweight script (<10 lines) logs AI bot visits (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, etc.)
   - Categorizes intent: `search-ai`, `training-ai`, `social-ai`, `monitoring`
   - Captures URL, timestamp, status code, user agent

2. **Snapshots Tool**
   - Simulates 100+ prompts across GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini, Perplexity, and xAI
   - Reveals brand rank, citation presence, and prompt coverage

3. **Visibility Scoring System**
   - Score out of 100 modeled after domain authority, but tuned for LLM visibility
   - 0–30: Minimal AI presence, 30–60: Growing brand recognition, 60+: Leader in generative visibility

4. **Attribution Layer**
   - Ties LLM crawler or answer visibility to web traffic, conversion paths, and CRM records
   - Segments by bot, page path, timeframe (24h to 90d)

5. **Link & AEO Audits**
   - Validates render method (SSR/CSR), schema markup, extractive formatting, structured data
   - Detects AI-readiness issues on a per-page basis with action-prioritized output

6. **Programmatic AEO Engine**
   - Content generator with longtail keyword coverage and structured layout
   - Automatically integrates citation logic, Q&A formatting, schema, and internal linking
   - Designed for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

7. **Integrations & Stack**
   - Works with: Next.js, Node.js, WordPress
   - Coming June 2025: Webflow, Framer
   - Built with Vercel AI SDK (GPT-4o), Firecrawl (audits), Supabase (data infra)

8. **Pricing Tiers**
   - Free: Weekly visibility, bot detection
   - $40 Visibility Plan: Daily tracking, snapshots
   - $200 Plus: Max visibility, 10 articles/month, up to 5 domains
   - $1000 Pro: Unlimited scans, 30 articles/month, 10+ domains, API access
   - Add-on: Visitor credit packs (normal = 1 credit, PRIME = 5 credits)

## Glossary

- **LLMO (LLM Optimization)**: Making your content machine-readable, token-efficient, and prompt-aligned
- **AEO**: Formatting for inclusion in answer engines (e.g. ChatGPT, SGE)
- **GEO**: Structuring for generative model recall and citation
- **Structured Signals**: Use of H2/H3, bullet lists, schema, canonical tags, etc.
- **Retrieval Surface Area**: Number of prompt/query variations a page could be cited from
- **Snapshot Prompts**: Query simulations used to test and score your visibility

## Use Cases

- Detect and classify LLM crawler traffic by source and behavior
- Audit content for AI-readiness and prompt extractability
- Benchmark brand visibility across multiple AI search engines
- Attribute LLM citations to real traffic, leads, and conversions
- Deploy AEO+GEO content strategies at scale
- Understand why LLMs cite you—or don’t

## Positioning

Split.dev = **Segment + Clearbit for LLMs**

Split tracks which AI models find your content (Segment) and ties those discoveries to real traffic and leads (Clearbit). For businesses focused on AI-native growth, Split is the attribution source of truth for visibility in large language models.

It also functions like **RB2B for generative search**: enriching visitor sessions based on LLM referrers, not just cookies or email opens.
