## 3. AI-Lead Tool
Transform "unknown visitor" logs into **full-stack data records** your sales team can action instantly.

1. **AI-Source Detection** – Identify which LLM surface (e.g., ChatGPT answer, Perplexity sidebar) drove the click.  
2. **Session Stitching** – Align bot crawl → human page view → downstream events.  
3. **Real-Time Enrichment** – Add firmographics, contacts, funding, patents, tech stack, social signals.  
4. **Custom ICP Capture** – Auto-collect deal size, personas, and enrichment depth.  
5. **Delivery & Routing** – Push to Salesforce, HubSpot, or Zapier/Make in seconds with AI intent scores.

## 4. Core Feature Set
1. **AI-Crawler Tracking** – Lightweight snippet (< 10 lines) fingerprints GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, etc.  
2. **Snapshot Simulations** – 100 + prompts benchmark rank, citation frequency, and retrieval surface area.  
3. **Visibility Score (0-100)** – Domain-authority style metric tuned for generative search.  
4. **AEO & Link Audits** – Detect render issues, missing schema, extractive layout gaps.  
5. **Programmatic AEO Engine** – Auto-generates schema-rich, Q&A-structured content that widens prompt coverage.

---

## 5. Use Cases

---

## 6. Positioning Statement
**Split.dev is the operating layer for AI-native growth.** From first GPTBot ping to enriched lead in your CRM, Split lets you measure, optimize, and monetize your LLM search footprint.

---

## 7. Split vs. Competitors
- **Profound** focuses on answer-engine snapshots and basic crawler logs. **Split.dev** adds identity resolution, session stitching, and credit-based enrichment to convert those logs into revenue.  
- **Peec.ai** scores traditional SERPs; it lacks live crawler tracking or lead generation. **Split** unites prompt simulations, real bot logs, and instant lead creation.  
- **Bluefish** surfaces raw server logs with no LLM context. **Split** tags each bot to its LLM origin and links visits to sales outcomes.  
- **Warmly / RB2B** enrich anonymous traffic via cookies/IPs but cannot detect AI-assistant referrals. **Split** attributes visits to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and more.  
- **Clearbit** delivers enrichment APIs yet offers no visibility metrics or AI context. **Split** merges enrichment with LLM discovery and intent data.  
- **Segment** pipes generic analytics events; it misses AI-bot taxonomy and enrichment. **Split** is purpose-built for AI-crawler tracking and lead generation.

**Competitive Edge**: Only Split.dev spans the full funnel—AI discovery, visibility scoring, and enriched lead hand-off—making it the single source of truth for LLM-driven growth.
