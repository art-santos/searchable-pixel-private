Perfect for SaaS companies simplifying customer data integration and businesses unifying internal systems for AI.\n\n![API Service](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2FAPI-icon-v2-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![API Service](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2FAPI-icon-v2-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![SQL Database](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2FSQL-icon-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![SQL Database](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2FSQL-icon-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![UIX Platform](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fuix-icon-v2-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![React Applications](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2Freact-icon-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nReact Hook\n\n![MCP Icon](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fmcp-icon-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nModel Context\n\nProtocol\n\n![Universal Endpoint](https://thinair.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fplug-icon-v2-3D.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nUniversal Endpoint\n\nThe Uix platform acts as a central intelligence hub. It automatically analyzes (introspects) your SQL databases and APIs (using JSON schemas where available, generated from API documentation where not) to generate a unified GraphQL schema. This allows your applicationsâ€”whether internal tools or customer-facing SaaS featuresâ€”to access all data through one consistent, secure endpoint (via our Model Context Protocol - MCP), eliminating integration complexity while respecting existing security.\n\n### Experience Unified Intelligence\n\nUix helps businesses unlock the potential of their data. If you run a SaaS platform, drastically cut down customer data integration time. If you're enhancing internal operations, unify your disparate systems effortlessly. By automatically understanding your data structures, Uix brings everything together.\n\n1\n\n#### Prepare Your Data Securely\n\nWe automatically analyze (introspect) your existing databases (or your customers' databases via secure connection) to make them AI-ready while ensuring security rules are respected.\n\n2\n\n#### Connect Systems for NLQ\n\nLink internal or external software (APIs) and data sources. Uix automatically understands API schemas to create a unified GraphQL layer (via MCP), safely translating natural language questions into precise data requests.\n\n3\n\n#### One Hub for Accurate Answers\n\nGet reliable answers from all connected data (your own or your customers') by asking questions naturally, maintaining consistent security across the board.\n\nExplore our platform\n\n### Secure by Design\n\nSecurity is built-in. Uix automatically generates a structured GraphQL layer from connected data sources. When you ask a question, our Model Context Protocol (MCP) uses this layer to structure the request \\*before\\* accessing data, preventing unsafe operations.\n\n#### Controlled & Validated Queries\n\nOur structured GraphQL approach, generated automatically by analyzing data structures (introspection), only permits valid requests, offering strong protection.\n\n#### Respects Existing Permissions\n\nYour existing database security rules (or those of your connected customer) are automatically recognized (introspected) and enforced.\n\n## Get Started\n\nReady to transform your business with AI?
