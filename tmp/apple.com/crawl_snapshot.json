VoiceOver is an industry‑leading screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your screen audibly, in braille, or both. Easily control and navigate your screen through simple gestures on a touchscreen, trackpad, or Bluetooth keyboard. On Apple Vision Pro, you can control and navigate your device with a combination of gestures using one or both hands. VoiceOver can describe your surroundings in great detail.

It uses the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of any physical object you point it at, like a menu or sign, so you can see all the details clearly on your screen. Use the flashlight or LED flash to light the object, adjust filters to help you differentiate colors, or freeze a specific frame to get a static close-up.\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Furniture Detection, Scenes, and Text Detection.[3](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-3) On iPhone you can use Detection Mode with the Action button to have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-4)\n\nIf there’s text on nearby physical objects, such as buttons on household appliances or labels on files, use Point and Speak to have it read aloud.[5](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-5) You can also use Reader Mode to view the text in a format that’s easier to read. Magnifier lets you temporarily capture a frame that contains text, so you can view it in a format adapted for easier reading and even adjust the font, size, and color of the text to your liking.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages.

Hear your entire screen read aloud with Speak Screen, and use Speech Controller to keep those controls onscreen so you can easily pause speaking, adjust the rate, or navigate forward or back to the content you want to hear. With Highlight Content, you can have words or sentences accentuated in a customized color and style as they’re read out loud.\n\nUse Speak Selection to have a specific range of text read to you. Or activate Typing Feedback to hear what you type spoken out loud character by character, word by word, with auto-corrections and auto-capitalizations as they appear.\n\nSpoken Content is available in over 80 distinct voices and more than 60 languages and locales, with options to customize settings such as pitch range for your preferred built-in voices.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-2) Languages are automatically detected to switch seamlessly between voices, so your spoken content won’t feel impersonal.\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Invert display colors, adjust transparency, modify how colors appear with color filters, and more.\n\nInvert display colors to make the background dark so text and content stand out. This can be useful in apps and websites that don’t support Dark Mode. Smart Invert reverses the colors on the display except for images, media, and some apps that use dark color styles, while Classic Invert reverses all colors on the display.\n\nColor filters let you view the entire screen in grayscale, adjust colors for color vision deficiencies, or tint the screen a color. Use Reduce White Point to tone down the intensity of bright colors. You can also make the display easier on your eyes as it gets dark out by turning on Night Shift, which automatically adjusts the colors of your display to the warmer end of the spectrum.\n\nSome backgrounds appear transparent or blurred by default. Turn on Reduce Transparency to make these backgrounds opaque by giving them a solid color and making them easier to see onscreen. You can also use Increase Contrast to turn up the color contrast between an app’s foreground and background colors.\n\nSome screen items rely on color to convey information. Use Differentiate Without Color to replace these with alternative ways to tell them apart, like shapes or text. Switches turn green when they are on. On/Off Labels adds a vertical line to switches to indicate when they’re on and a circle to indicate when they’re off. Turn on Button Shapes to underline any text that performs an action when you tap it, so it’s easier to identify these elements onscreen.\n\nText Size helps make text more legible and visible with simple font adjustments. With Larger Text you can adjust the size using an accessibility slider, while Bold Text gives weight to the words on your screen. Your preferred settings will be applied only to the apps you choose.\n\n**Set up Display settings on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e1fb0)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/change-display-colors-ipad674f91c0/18.0/ipados/18.0)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-display-colors-easier-onscreen-mchl11ddd4b3/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/adjust-text-size-and-other-visual-settings-apd766b7bd85/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvbf413b243/16.0/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/display-text-size-tan5b0340be2/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph53475523f)\n\n**Set up Text Size on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/customize-the-text-size-and-zoom-setting-iphd6804774e/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246013)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/make-text-and-icons-bigger-mchld786f2cd/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/adjust-text-size-and-other-visual-settings-apd766b7bd85/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/display-bold-text-atvb0222141c/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/adjust-text-display-settings-tan5b0340be2/visionos)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph53475523f)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to adjust text size on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R0mpzMkSjI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=15)\n- [How to customize accessibility settings app by app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sHaXuFb6uk&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=31)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Support for CarPlay.** Color filters and Bold Text help make your CarPlay screen easier to see.\n\n**Support for Apple Vision Pro.** Make it easier to see what’s in your field of view with Smart Color Invert and Reduce Transparency.\n\nSpoken ContentVehicle Motion Cues\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_dim_flashing_lights__fz37txo1m96y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Vehicle Motion Cues\n\nHelps passengers reduce motion sickness while using their device in a car.\n\nRead more about Vehicle Motion\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_dim_flashing_lights__fz37txo1m96y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Vehicle Motion Cues\n\nWhen you want to use iPhone or iPad while a passenger in a moving vehicle, Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness.[6](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-6) Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, dots appear on your screen and move with the motion of the vehicle to reduce sensory conflict — a common cause of motion sickness.

Through Sign Language Prominence, FaceTime detects when you’re using sign language in Group FaceTime calls and automatically highlights your tile to make you prominent in the conversation. You can also use simple hand gestures to add a reaction that fills the camera frame with 3D augmented reality effects like hearts or confetti.[18](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-18)\n\nStaying connected is even easier with Live Captions in FaceTime, which can caption speech in one-on-one and Group FaceTime calls with speaker attribution, so you can easily track who is speaking during group calls.[12](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-12) And on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Live Speech integrates seamlessly with FaceTime — just type your responses and your device speaks them out loud to others on the call. Or quickly chime in with your favorite saved phrases during animated conversations.\n\n**Set up FaceTime on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph7801d5771)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad6b71e29e)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/facetime/get-started-with-facetime-on-mac-fctmb754bbc2/36/mac)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvb874c905e)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/make-or-receive-a-facetime-call-tan440238696/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Live Captions in FaceTime on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAQFeb2GfM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=21)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Live Captions in FaceTime for tvOS.** Read what others are saying on a FaceTime call from the biggest screen in the home.\n\nSound RecognitionSensory Alerts\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_audio_settings__f648ne7fney6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Sensory Alerts\n\nGet your notifications through sound, vibrations, a flashing light, or all three.\n\nRead more about Sensory Alerts\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_audio_settings__f648ne7fney6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Sensory Alerts\n\nYour device can alert you in a way you’ll notice. Choose visual or vibrating alerts for incoming Phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an LED light flash for incoming calls or have your iPhone display a photo of the caller. If you’re on your Mac, have it flash its screen when an app needs your attention. You can also turn on haptics to play when Face ID successfully unlocks, authorizes Apple Pay, or verifies a purchase.\n\nApple Watch lets you adjust the strength of the taps and vibrations that it uses for alerts and notifications. You can even add an extra haptic tap that pre-announces your other haptic alerts. Turn on Crown Haptics to get haptic feedback when you turn the Digital Crown to scroll.

In addition to transcribing speech in a scene, they capture nonverbal communication, music, and sound effects. Supported in apps like the Apple TV app, closed captions are available in more than 40 languages for movies, TV shows, videos, and podcasts — just look for the CC icon.

Apple Watch periodically measures the sound levels throughout the day while you’re wearing your watch. This uses the microphone but does not record or save any sounds. If the average sound level over three minutes reaches or exceeds a chosen decibel threshold, your Apple Watch can notify you.\n\nWhen you configure the Noise app on Apple Watch and connect compatible headphones, Control Center notifies you if the sounds playing through the headphones reach unsafe levels.[23](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-23) And all your information is stored in the Health app on iPhone for easy access to your data whenever you need it.\n\n**Set up Noise app on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209593)\n\nTranscriptionsSiri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Siri\n\nStreamline a series of tasks and ask Siri to do them for you by voice or by text.\n\nRead more about Siri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Siri\n\nUse voice or text to have Siri help you complete the tasks you do every day — or just answer questions you’re curious about.[24](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-24) Ask or use Type to Siri to find definitions, set reminders, turn features on or off, and more. If you need to streamline a series of actions or tasks, you can use Siri to run custom shortcuts through the Shortcuts app. Run your shortcut by saying “Hey Siri” or “Siri” and then the name of the shortcut you created.[25](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-25) Made for iPhone hearing devices can use Siri to announce notifications for iPhone and iPad. And if you’re using Safari Reader and want to hear text read out loud, just say “Siri, read this” when you’re browsing a Reader-compatible site. If you have a speech disability, Siri can listen for atypical speech. You can also customize the speed at which Siri speaks to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nCommunicating with Siri is even more natural thanks to richer language understanding from Apple Intelligence. If you change your mind mid-sentence, Siri can follow right along. For example, you might say “Siri, set an alarm — wait no, sorry, I meant a timer for 5 minutes — actually, let’s make that 10.” Siri Pause Time lets you adjust the amount of time Siri waits before responding, so you can speak comfortably at your own pace without worrying about being interrupted. And once you activate Siri, you can make multiple requests back to back without needing to say “Siri” repeatedly.[26](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-26)\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri can assist you in ways that are unique to you and can help reduce your cognitive load.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-9) Deeper product knowledge across thousands of topics enables Siri to give you step-by-step directions on how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Siri also maintains context so you can refer to something you mentioned in a previous request. For example, if you created a Calendar event, you can ask “What will the weather be like there?”\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Live Speech can help you generate real-time responses to stay connected during Phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. You can also save commonly used phrases to help you easily respond during daily interactions and conversations. For example, you can create a Coffee Shop category to group phrases you frequently use, such as “I’d like to order a tea” or “May I have cream and sugar with that?” Live Speech even allows the audio from apps to be audible in voice and video calls, which can be helpful if you use apps that assist with speaking and communication.\n\n**Set up Live Speech on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/type-to-speak-iphcf92d2d9b/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/type-to-speak-ipad32ad5293/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl86b6234f)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd86a007717/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/live-speech-tan9351d794e/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to set up and use Personal Voice and Live Speech on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRXswd7yaRk)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Categories for Live Speech.** Live Speech and Live Captions work together, and Live Speech offers the ability to group phrases into categories like Saved or Recent or user-generated categories like Food or School.\n\nSiriPersonal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Personal Voice\n\nCreate a voice that sounds like you.\n\nRead more about Personal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Personal Voice\n\nIf you are at risk of voice loss or have a condition that can progressively impact your voice, Personal Voice can help.

This feature uses on-device machine learning to keep your information private and secure. And Personal Voice seamlessly integrates with Live Speech, so you can type what you want to say and have your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch speak it aloud in the voice you created. Personal Voice also works with third-party augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps and other apps that you allow.\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Use the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate Eye Tracking in seconds. And thanks to on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on your device and isn’t shared with Apple. Eye Tracking works with iOS and iPadOS apps and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories.[35](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-35) To help you navigate through different apps, you can use Dwell Control, which enables you to interact with controls by keeping your eyes on them for a selected amount of time. And Eye Tracking lets you access additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes or even type using only your eyes. iPad also supports third-party eye trackers.\n\n**Set up Eye Tracking on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph66057d0f6)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad2cd35723)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to set up and use Eye Tracking on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8LimeLV_Kk&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=2&pp=iAQB)\n\nVoice ControlAlternative input\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_alternative_input__fpw4ej772u6i_large_2x.png)\n\n### Alternative input\n\nControl your device without using your hands or fingers.\n\nRead more about alternative input\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_alternative_input__fpw4ej772u6i_large_2x.png)\n\n## Alternative input\n\nThere are many ways to navigate and control your devices without using your hands or fingers. Head Tracking uses the camera on your device to follow the movement of your head to control a pointer on your screen, and it tracks your facial movements to perform actions.[36](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-36)\n\nPointer Control on Mac lets you use different methods, like head movements, to control your pointer and mouse or trackpad button. You can set options to specify the way the pointer moves, how fast it moves, which switches to use for head pointer actions, and which camera to use. Alternate pointer actions let you use keyboard shortcuts, assistive switches, or facial expressions to perform mouse actions, such as left, right, or double clicks or other custom actions to suit your needs.\n\n**Set up alternative input on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/move-the-pointer-using-head-pointer-mchlb2d4782b/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-pointer-to-navigate-tan3869c8a85/visionos)\n\nEye TrackingAssistiveTouch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nCustomize how you interact with your touchscreen.\n\nRead more about Assistive Touch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## AssistiveTouch\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nAssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS enables you to adapt your touchscreen to ﬁt your physical needs. If certain gestures, like pinch or two-finger tap, don’t work for you, swap them with a gesture that does or create a touch that’s all your own. You can also use AssistiveTouch to replace pressing buttons. You can customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu or connect a Bluetooth device to control an onscreen pointer for navigation. And with Virtual Trackpad on iPad, you can control your device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\nAssistiveTouch for Apple Watch helps those with upper-body limb differences use hand gestures such as clench, double clench, tap, and double tap to control apps and experiences across Apple Watch.[37](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-37) With the Motion Pointer, you can control your Apple Watch by tilting the watch up and down and side to side. Adjust Motion Pointer settings for sensitivity, activation time, movement tolerance, and hot edges.\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, you can assign gestures, such as single tap, double tap, or long press, that run custom actions when you interact with the AssistiveTouch menu button. You can also customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu and connect assistive pointer devices via Bluetooth, Lightning, USB, or USB‑C.\n\n**Set up AssistiveTouch on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-assistivetouch-tan4ddb28816/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use AssistiveTouch on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j4-NTg3QsE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=25&t=3s)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Virtual Trackpad.** If you have limited mobility, you can control your iPad using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\n### Quick Actions for Apple Watch\n\nMerge subtle movement with skillful multitasking through Quick Actions for Apple Watch. You can do even more with your Apple Watch without ever touching the display or turning on AssistiveTouch for Apple Watch. Double‑tap with your hand to easily answer a phone call, snap a photo, pause your music, resume your daily workout, and much more. You can find and enable Quick Actions in Accessibility settings on your Apple Watch.[38](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-38)\n\n**Set up Quick Actions for Apple Watch on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use AssistiveTouch on Apple Watch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=869--vIUIv4&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=12)\n\nAlternative inputTouch settings\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Touch settings\n\nAdjust how your devices respond to your touch.\n\nRead more about Touch Settings\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Touch settings\n\n### Touch Accommodations\n\nAdjust how the screen responds to your touch with Touch Accommodations. Control how long you touch before it’s recognized or whether repeat touches are ignored. With Tap Assistance, if you accidentally perform a swipe gesture, your device can determine whether your initial touch location or your final touch is read as your intended tap location. Enable Final Touch Location to put your ﬁnger down anywhere on the screen and move to the point where you want to tap before the timer is finished. When you use iPhone with one hand in portrait orientation, you can use Reachability to lower the top half of the screen so it’s within easy reach of your thumb.\n\nYou can adjust accessibility settings for the side button on an iPhone with Face ID. Choose the speed required to double-click or triple-click the button. Or use AssistiveTouch or Switch Control to confirm payments with Face ID instead of double-clicking the side button. You can also modify accessibility settings for Camera Control on iPhone. Change the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control or the speed required to lightly double-press it. Or adjust the gesture you use to access controls like Zoom or Depth.\n\n**Set up Touch Accommodations on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208433)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Touch Accommodations on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTOhANVkrA&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=6)\n- [How to reach the top of your iPhone screen with one hand, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bawpMvdXk8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=13)\n\n### Back Tap\n\nMeet the easiest shortcut ever. Back Tap lets you double‑tap or triple‑tap the back of your iPhone to perform actions like taking a screenshot, turning on an accessibility feature, or running a shortcut. Choose from more than 20 different actions or create your own automated shortcuts in the Shortcuts app to simplify your everyday tasks.[29](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-29)\n\n**Set up Back Tap on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-tap-iphaa57e7885/ios)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Use Shortcuts to automate tasks on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/shortcuts-iph47e1c9d7d/ios)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Back Tap on iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ZeFJ65iXc&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=16)\n\nAssistiveTouchHardware keyboard support\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Hardware keyboard support\n\nMakes typing easier with keyboard adjustments to fit your needs.\n\nRead more about Hardware Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Hardware keyboard support\n\nIf you use Magic Keyboard or another physical keyboard with your devices, you can adjust the sensitivity of keys and make it easier to press combinations of keys. Turn on Full Keyboard Access on Mac to navigate and control your Mac with only the keyboard. You can also change the appearance of the cursor — make the Full Keyboard Access cursor wider, or choose a color and increase contrast so it’s easier to spot on the screen.\n\nWith Key Repeat, you can set how long you must press and hold a key before it starts repeating and how fast it repeats once it starts. Or you can prevent the key from repeating at all. Slow Keys lets you adjust the amount of time between when a key is pressed and when it is activated, so your device processes only the keystrokes you mean to make. Sticky Keys enables you to enter key combinations sequentially rather than simultaneously. Or use Mouse Keys to control your pointer with a numeric keypad on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can also create custom shortcuts for commonly used words or phrases, and your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will type them for you.\n\n**Set up hardware keyboard support on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keyboards-ipha7c3927eb/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/keyboards-ipad424a3e13/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-keyboard-settings-for-accessibility-mchlae61a6de/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/control-your-device-with-an-external-keyboard-tan170e01fda/visionos)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Control iPhone with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-iphone-with-an-external-keyboard-ipha4375873f/ios)\n- [Control iPad with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/control-ipad-with-an-external-keyboard-ipad5f765d6f/ipados)\n- [Navigate your Mac using Full Keyboard Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/navigate-your-mac-using-full-keyboard-access-mchlc06d1059/mac)\n\nTouch settingsAccessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Accessibility Keyboard\n\nCustomize how you type on your Mac.\n\nRead more about Accessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Accessibility Keyboard\n\nThe customizable, onscreen Accessibility Keyboard lets you navigate and type in macOS without using a physical keyboard. It includes support for custom toolbars and improved typing with auto-capitalization and better word suggestions.

Designed with feedback from individuals with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters, Assistive Access offers a distinctive interface with high-contrast buttons, large text labels, and visual alternatives to text. It also has tools to help individuals and their supporters adjust the experience in specific apps.\n\nAssistive Access includes customized experiences for Phone and FaceTime (which have been combined into a single Calls app), Messages, Camera, Photos, Music, and Magnifier. For those who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message. Choose a more visual, grid-based layout for your Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout if you prefer text. Assistive Access also supports third-party apps, including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps.\n\n**Set up Assistive Access on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-ipad/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ipados)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Make calls with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/make-calls-devad3c7dd65/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Take photos and videos with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/take-photos-and-videos-dev4e133cf212/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Send messages with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/send-messages-deva0c04b931/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Play music with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/play-music-dev50df63992/18.0/ios/18.0)\n\nFitness appsApple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Apple Intelligence\n\nSupports effective written communication and improves reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nRead more about Apple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Apple Intelligence\n\nThere are many ways Apple Intelligence can help enhance your written communication, reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nTransform how you communicate with Writing Tools. Use them to proofread your text, rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize text with a tap. And in the Notes or Phone app, you can capture audio recordings and transcripts and then get a summary of your transcripts for easy reference later. Writing Tools are available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-9)\n\nApple Intelligence can also help you get through your inbox faster. Priority messages in Mail elevate time-sensitive messages to the top of your inbox, so you know what to read first when you open Mail. Brief summaries appear in the email preview and in the conversation list in Messages, so you know the key information before you even open the thread. And when you open an email thread in Mail, you can tap to see a summary that helps you get the gist of a lengthy email exchange. You can even quickly respond to messages in Mail and Messages with Smart Reply, which offers response options based on your conversation.\n\nWith the power of Apple Intelligence, your devices can understand the notifications you receive, summarize them, and organize them in a way that prioritizes what’s most important to you. Priority notifications appear at the top of the stack on your Lock Screen, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance.

If you have strong verbal skills but your spelling or typing could use an assist, just go to any text field and tap the microphone button on the onscreen keyboard to start dictating. Or simply look at the microphone button in a search field and start speaking to dictate text on Apple Vision Pro. And you can activate Dictation through Keyboard settings on your Mac to turn your speech into text. Fluidly switch between voice and touch so you can continue to interact with your onscreen keyboard to move the cursor or insert QuickType suggestions.[40](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-40) Punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks are automatically added to your text as you speak.[41](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-41) You can even insert emoji into messages using just your voice.[42](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-42)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#dictation) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#dictation) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up Dictation on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/dictate-text-iph2c0651d2/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/dictate-text-ipad997d9642/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-dictation-mh40584/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/send-messages-apd92a90f882/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/activate-siri-search-or-dictation-atvb16053d68/18.0/tvos/18.0)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/enter-text-and-use-dictation-tana14220eef/visionos)\n\nGuided AccessFocus\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_focus__dppor8rlsqs2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Focus\n\nCustomize the notifications and calls you receive at specific times.\n\nRead more about Focus\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_focus__dppor8rlsqs2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Focus\n\nWith Focus, it’s even easier to home in on what’s most important to you. Activate different Focus areas like Do Not Disturb, Work, or Sleep to silence device notifications that may disturb or distract you in the moment. Reduce Interruptions understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention, like a text about picking up your child from daycare later today.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-43) A streamlined setup for Focus enables you to select the apps or people you want to receive notifications from by either allowing or silencing them.\n\nYou can connect your Lock Screen to your Focus of choice so the look and feel of your iPhone matches how you want to use it at that time — simply swipe to the corresponding Lock Screen to activate a Focus. And Focus filters help you set boundaries in Apple apps like Calendar and Messages, as well as third-party apps, by hiding distracting content. Choose a set of Tab Groups to show up in Safari while in the Work Focus, or hide your work calendar altogether when you’re using the Personal Focus. You can even set a Focus area to turn on at a certain time or location or when you’re using a specific app.\n\n**Set up Focus on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/set-up-a-focus-ipad2789d162/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-a-focus-to-stay-on-task-mchl613dc43f/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-focus-apd6640937c4/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/set-up-a-focus-tan025fade1f/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Reduce Interruptions.** This Focus area understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?cognitive#footnote-43)\n\nDictation\n\n## Select any combination of accessibility categories, needs, and devices to help refine your results.\n\nFilter\n\nCategories\n(1)\n\nSelected: Cognitive\n\nVisionHearingSpeechMobilityCognitive\n\nNeeds\n\n\nNo selections\n\nBlindnessLow VisionMotion SensitivityDeafnessHard of HearingAtypical SpeechNonspeakingAlternative InputDexterityLimb DifferenceComprehensionAttentionCommunication\n\nDevices\n\n\nNo selections\n\niPhoneiPadMacApple WatchApple TVHomePodApple Vision ProCarPlayHeadphones\n\nResetReset\n\n**13 results**\n\n**Selection**\n\nCognitive\n\n- ## Vision\n\n\n\nThese features can help you navigate your surroundings, control your devices, or customize your display if you’re blind, have low vision, or just prefer larger text.\n\n\n\n![Person with low vision wearing AirPods and walking with service dog](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/features/header_vision__dv5w4rabxawm_large_2x.png)![Person with low vision wearing AirPods and walking with service dog](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/features/header_vision_dark__cflwvyxvg56q_large_2x.png)\n\n\n  -

Voiceover\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_voiceover__fd6trvpl5nmi_large_2x.png)\n\n## VoiceOver\n\n### VoiceOver\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver is an industry‑leading screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your screen audibly, in braille, or both. Easily control and navigate your screen through simple gestures on a touchscreen, trackpad, or Bluetooth keyboard. On Apple Vision Pro, you can control and navigate your device with a combination of gestures using one or both hands. VoiceOver can describe your surroundings in great detail. With Live Recognition, you’ll get descriptions of objects in the real world, such as people, doors, text, and furniture in indoor spaces.[1](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-1) VoiceOver offers deep customization options, like modifying your favorite built-in voice for speech feedback and tailoring its verbosity, speed, and accompanying sound and haptic feedback to your preferences.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-2)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-voiceover) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#accessibility-voice-over-live-speech-spoken-content) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up VoiceOver on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246898/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/get-started-vo4be8816d70/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apdaabc79d3b/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvbfa4ff6cd/tvos)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/105025)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-tanae5174040/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to navigate your iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROIe49kXOc8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=5)\n- [How to hear image descriptions in the Camera app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnoeaUpHKxY&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=38)\n- [How to organize apps with the VoiceOver rotor on your iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Ds-I2L6PI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=47)\n- [How to choose a new voice for VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ols9d9urQ&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=47)\n- [How to customize VoiceOver pronunciation on your iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLbZ2F_V6U&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=40)\n- [How to turn on Emoji Suffix with VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHNyn_fU8Q&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=28)\n- [How to use Screen Curtain with VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCHdVdocouw&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=42)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**New voices and more.** For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver includes new voices, a flexible voice rotor, independent volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac.\n\n**Live Recognition.** Quickly get descriptions of objects in the real world, such as people, doors, text, and furniture in indoor spaces.[1](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-1)\n\n### VoiceOver + braille\n\nYou can also connect a Bluetooth wireless refreshable braille display and use it to control and navigate your Apple device. Read and type using contracted or uncontracted braille, or enter braille directly on the touchscreen using Braille Screen Input. VoiceOver supports many international braille tables. When communicating or working with sighted individuals, you can turn on the braille panel to display a language translation of the braille onscreen. Apple devices also support multiline text braille displays.

It uses the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of any physical object you point it at, like a menu or sign, so you can see all the details clearly on your screen. Use the flashlight or LED flash to light the object, adjust filters to help you differentiate colors, or freeze a specific frame to get a static close-up.\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Furniture Detection, Scenes, and Text Detection.[3](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-3) On iPhone you can use Detection Mode with the Action button to have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-4)\n\nIf there’s text on nearby physical objects, such as buttons on household appliances or labels on files, use Point and Speak to have it read aloud.[5](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-5) You can also use Reader Mode to view the text in a format that’s easier to read. Magnifier lets you temporarily capture a frame that contains text, so you can view it in a format adapted for easier reading and even adjust the font, size, and color of the text to your liking.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-image-descriptions) for Scenes in Detection Mode availability. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-text-detection) for Text Detection availability.\n\n**Set up Magnifier on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphe867dc99c)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-ipad-like-a-magnifying-glass-ipadd86f5027/ipados)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [A tip for using Magnifier on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqrhEDtL1mI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=23)\n- [How to use Point and Speak on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPt34n3aAM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=9)\n- [How to use Detection Mode in Magnifier on iPhone or iPad with LiDAR, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI0KrPmS-DI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=20&t=3s)\n- [How to use People Detection on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyzkIhNIhgE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=41)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Reader Mode.** Magnifier offers a Reader Mode that can display a text image in a format for easy reading, with customizations such as adjusting the font, font size, or background color.\n\n**Detection Mode with Action button.** Detection Mode enables you to quickly and seamlessly find information about the real world. And on iPhone you can use the Action button to describe scenes. Just press the button and have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-4)\n\nVoiceOverSpoken Content\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_spoken_content__gdfl7nas1mq2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Spoken Content\n\nReads any text on your screen aloud, including letters and words as you type.\n\nRead more about Spoken Content\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_spoken_content__gdfl7nas1mq2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Spoken Content\n\nSpoken Content includes a collection of features designed to enhance your reading or writing with audio. Hear your entire screen read aloud with Speak Screen, and use Speech Controller to keep those controls onscreen so you can easily pause speaking, adjust the rate, or navigate forward or back to the content you want to hear. With Highlight Content, you can have words or sentences accentuated in a customized color and style as they’re read out loud.\n\nUse Speak Selection to have a specific range of text read to you.

Invert display colors, adjust transparency, modify how colors appear with color filters, and more.\n\nInvert display colors to make the background dark so text and content stand out. This can be useful in apps and websites that don’t support Dark Mode. Smart Invert reverses the colors on the display except for images, media, and some apps that use dark color styles, while Classic Invert reverses all colors on the display.\n\nColor filters let you view the entire screen in grayscale, adjust colors for color vision deficiencies, or tint the screen a color. Use Reduce White Point to tone down the intensity of bright colors. You can also make the display easier on your eyes as it gets dark out by turning on Night Shift, which automatically adjusts the colors of your display to the warmer end of the spectrum.\n\nSome backgrounds appear transparent or blurred by default. Turn on Reduce Transparency to make these backgrounds opaque by giving them a solid color and making them easier to see onscreen. You can also use Increase Contrast to turn up the color contrast between an app’s foreground and background colors.\n\nSome screen items rely on color to convey information. Use Differentiate Without Color to replace these with alternative ways to tell them apart, like shapes or text. Switches turn green when they are on. On/Off Labels adds a vertical line to switches to indicate when they’re on and a circle to indicate when they’re off. Turn on Button Shapes to underline any text that performs an action when you tap it, so it’s easier to identify these elements onscreen.\n\nText Size helps make text more legible and visible with simple font adjustments. With Larger Text you can adjust the size using an accessibility slider, while Bold Text gives weight to the words on your screen. Your preferred settings will be applied only to the apps you choose.\n\n**Set up Display settings on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e1fb0)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/change-display-colors-ipad674f91c0/18.0/ipados/18.0)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-display-colors-easier-onscreen-mchl11ddd4b3/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/adjust-text-size-and-other-visual-settings-apd766b7bd85/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvbf413b243/16.0/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/display-text-size-tan5b0340be2/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph53475523f)\n\n**Set up Text Size on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/customize-the-text-size-and-zoom-setting-iphd6804774e/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246013)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/make-text-and-icons-bigger-mchld786f2cd/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/adjust-text-size-and-other-visual-settings-apd766b7bd85/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/display-bold-text-atvb0222141c/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/adjust-text-display-settings-tan5b0340be2/visionos)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph53475523f)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to adjust text size on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R0mpzMkSjI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=15)\n- [How to customize accessibility settings app by app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sHaXuFb6uk&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=31)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Support for CarPlay.** Color filters and Bold Text help make your CarPlay screen easier to see.\n\n**Support for Apple Vision Pro.** Make it easier to see what’s in your field of view with Smart Color Invert and Reduce Transparency.\n\nSpoken ContentVehicle Motion Cues\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_dim_flashing_lights__fz37txo1m96y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Vehicle Motion Cues\n\nHelps passengers reduce motion sickness while using their device in a car.\n\nRead more about Vehicle Motion\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_dim_flashing_lights__fz37txo1m96y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Vehicle Motion Cues\n\nWhen you want to use iPhone or iPad while a passenger in a moving vehicle, Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness.[6](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-6) Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, dots appear on your screen and move with the motion of the vehicle to reduce sensory conflict — a common cause of motion sickness.

Choose Full Screen Zoom to magnify the entire screen, or Window Zoom to magnify only part of the screen with a resizable lens.[8](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-8) Follow Focus tracks your selections, the text insertion point, and your typing. Smart Typing magnifies the text area and keeps the keyboard unmagnified while typing. With Zoom Filters, you can apply Inverted, Grayscale, Grayscale Inverted, or Low Light to the magnified area.\n\nZoom also works with VoiceOver, so you can more clearly see and hear what’s happening on your screen. Split-screen zoom on Mac lets you see content up close and at a distance simultaneously.

Shortcuts can automate a variety of things, like getting directions to the next event on your calendar or moving text from one app to another. You can use the Shortcuts app to add ready-made or custom shortcuts to your devices. It lets you combine multiple steps across multiple apps to create powerful task automations. Siri can also suggest simple, useful shortcuts based on your app usage. Once you create a shortcut, just activate Siri, then say the shortcut’s name to run it.\n\nThe Shortcuts app Gallery features Shortcuts for Accessibility — a curated collection of ready-to-use tools that support a wide range of needs. Shortcuts for features like VoiceOver and AssistiveTouch let you quickly toggle them on and off. If you have short-term memory loss, you can use Remember This to log what happens throughout the day.

Audio is picked up by the device’s microphone and sent to your AirPods, Beats headphones, or Made for iPhone hearing devices, so you can hear what’s being said more clearly.[16](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-16)\n\n**Set up Live Listen on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/live-listen-iph8bf9386f5/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/live-listen-ipad85f8f503/ipados)\n- [AirPods Max](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [AirPods Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [AirPods](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Powerbeats Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Beats Fit Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Made for iPhone hearing devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203990)\n\nAudio settingsSound Recognition\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_sound_recognition__cwya9s0nxjee_large_2x.png)\n\n### Sound Recognition\n\nListens for specific sounds and notifies you when they are detected.\n\nRead more about Sound Recognition\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_sound_recognition__cwya9s0nxjee_large_2x.png)\n\n## Sound Recognition\n\nSound Recognition listens for certain sounds and uses on‑device intelligence to notify you when they are detected. This feature recognizes 15 different sounds — or you can train your device to listen for electronic sounds that are unique to your environment, like the beeping of appliances in your kitchen, specific types of alarms, or doorbells. On HomePod, Sound Recognition can also detect the sound of a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm. Sound Recognition supports CarPlay, too. Your iPhone will listen for and detect sirens and horns.

With high-quality video and a fast frame rate, FaceTime ensures that you never miss a moment. Through Sign Language Prominence, FaceTime detects when you’re using sign language in Group FaceTime calls and automatically highlights your tile to make you prominent in the conversation. You can also use simple hand gestures to add a reaction that fills the camera frame with 3D augmented reality effects like hearts or confetti.[18](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-18)\n\nStaying connected is even easier with Live Captions in FaceTime, which can caption speech in one-on-one and Group FaceTime calls with speaker attribution, so you can easily track who is speaking during group calls.[12](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-12) And on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Live Speech integrates seamlessly with FaceTime — just type your responses and your device speaks them out loud to others on the call.

You can also turn on haptics to play when Face ID successfully unlocks, authorizes Apple Pay, or verifies a purchase.\n\nApple Watch lets you adjust the strength of the taps and vibrations that it uses for alerts and notifications. You can even add an extra haptic tap that pre-announces your other haptic alerts. Turn on Crown Haptics to get haptic feedback when you turn the Digital Crown to scroll.

Apple Watch periodically measures the sound levels throughout the day while you’re wearing your watch. This uses the microphone but does not record or save any sounds. If the average sound level over three minutes reaches or exceeds a chosen decibel threshold, your Apple Watch can notify you.\n\nWhen you configure the Noise app on Apple Watch and connect compatible headphones, Control Center notifies you if the sounds playing through the headphones reach unsafe levels.[23](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-23) And all your information is stored in the Health app on iPhone for easy access to your data whenever you need it.\n\n**Set up Noise app on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209593)\n\nTranscriptionsSiri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Siri\n\nStreamline a series of tasks and ask Siri to do them for you by voice or by text.\n\nRead more about Siri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Siri\n\nUse voice or text to have Siri help you complete the tasks you do every day — or just answer questions you’re curious about.[24](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-24) Ask or use Type to Siri to find definitions, set reminders, turn features on or off, and more. If you need to streamline a series of actions or tasks, you can use Siri to run custom shortcuts through the Shortcuts app. Run your shortcut by saying “Hey Siri” or “Siri” and then the name of the shortcut you created.[25](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-25) Made for iPhone hearing devices can use Siri to announce notifications for iPhone and iPad. And if you’re using Safari Reader and want to hear text read out loud, just say “Siri, read this” when you’re browsing a Reader-compatible site. If you have a speech disability, Siri can listen for atypical speech. You can also customize the speed at which Siri speaks to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nCommunicating with Siri is even more natural thanks to richer language understanding from Apple Intelligence. If you change your mind mid-sentence, Siri can follow right along. For example, you might say “Siri, set an alarm — wait no, sorry, I meant a timer for 5 minutes — actually, let’s make that 10.” Siri Pause Time lets you adjust the amount of time Siri waits before responding, so you can speak comfortably at your own pace without worrying about being interrupted. And once you activate Siri, you can make multiple requests back to back without needing to say “Siri” repeatedly.[26](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-26)\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri can assist you in ways that are unique to you and can help reduce your cognitive load.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-9) Deeper product knowledge across thousands of topics enables Siri to give you step-by-step directions on how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Siri also maintains context so you can refer to something you mentioned in a previous request. For example, if you created a Calendar event, you can ask “What will the weather be like there?”\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Live Speech can help you generate real-time responses to stay connected during Phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. You can also save commonly used phrases to help you easily respond during daily interactions and conversations. For example, you can create a Coffee Shop category to group phrases you frequently use, such as “I’d like to order a tea” or “May I have cream and sugar with that?” Live Speech even allows the audio from apps to be audible in voice and video calls, which can be helpful if you use apps that assist with speaking and communication.\n\n**Set up Live Speech on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/type-to-speak-iphcf92d2d9b/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/type-to-speak-ipad32ad5293/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl86b6234f)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd86a007717/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/live-speech-tan9351d794e/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to set up and use Personal Voice and Live Speech on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRXswd7yaRk)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Categories for Live Speech.** Live Speech and Live Captions work together, and Live Speech offers the ability to group phrases into categories like Saved or Recent or user-generated categories like Food or School.\n\nSiriPersonal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Personal Voice\n\nCreate a voice that sounds like you.\n\nRead more about Personal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Personal Voice\n\nIf you are at risk of voice loss or have a condition that can progressively impact your voice, Personal Voice can help. It’s a simple and secure way to create a voice that sounds like you.[27](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-27) Read through a series of randomized text prompts to record 15 minutes of audio that can be used to generate a voice that sounds similar to your own.[28](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-28) If you have difficulty pronouncing or reading full sentences, you can even create your Personal Voice using short, three-word phrases. This feature uses on-device machine learning to keep your information private and secure. And Personal Voice seamlessly integrates with Live Speech, so you can type what you want to say and have your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch speak it aloud in the voice you created. Personal Voice also works with third-party augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps and other apps that you allow.\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Head Tracking uses the camera on your device to follow the movement of your head to control a pointer on your screen, and it tracks your facial movements to perform actions.[36](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-36)\n\nPointer Control on Mac lets you use different methods, like head movements, to control your pointer and mouse or trackpad button. You can set options to specify the way the pointer moves, how fast it moves, which switches to use for head pointer actions, and which camera to use. Alternate pointer actions let you use keyboard shortcuts, assistive switches, or facial expressions to perform mouse actions, such as left, right, or double clicks or other custom actions to suit your needs.\n\n**Set up alternative input on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/move-the-pointer-using-head-pointer-mchlb2d4782b/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-pointer-to-navigate-tan3869c8a85/visionos)\n\nEye TrackingAssistiveTouch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nCustomize how you interact with your touchscreen.\n\nRead more about Assistive Touch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## AssistiveTouch\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nAssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS enables you to adapt your touchscreen to ﬁt your physical needs. If certain gestures, like pinch or two-finger tap, don’t work for you, swap them with a gesture that does or create a touch that’s all your own. You can also use AssistiveTouch to replace pressing buttons. You can customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu or connect a Bluetooth device to control an onscreen pointer for navigation. And with Virtual Trackpad on iPad, you can control your device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\nAssistiveTouch for Apple Watch helps those with upper-body limb differences use hand gestures such as clench, double clench, tap, and double tap to control apps and experiences across Apple Watch.[37](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-37) With the Motion Pointer, you can control your Apple Watch by tilting the watch up and down and side to side. Adjust Motion Pointer settings for sensitivity, activation time, movement tolerance, and hot edges.\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, you can assign gestures, such as single tap, double tap, or long press, that run custom actions when you interact with the AssistiveTouch menu button. You can also customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu and connect assistive pointer devices via Bluetooth, Lightning, USB, or USB‑C.\n\n**Set up AssistiveTouch on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-assistivetouch-tan4ddb28816/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use AssistiveTouch on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j4-NTg3QsE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=25&t=3s)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Virtual Trackpad.** If you have limited mobility, you can control your iPad using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\n### Quick Actions for Apple Watch\n\nMerge subtle movement with skillful multitasking through Quick Actions for Apple Watch.

Control how long you touch before it’s recognized or whether repeat touches are ignored. With Tap Assistance, if you accidentally perform a swipe gesture, your device can determine whether your initial touch location or your final touch is read as your intended tap location. Enable Final Touch Location to put your ﬁnger down anywhere on the screen and move to the point where you want to tap before the timer is finished. When you use iPhone with one hand in portrait orientation, you can use Reachability to lower the top half of the screen so it’s within easy reach of your thumb.\n\nYou can adjust accessibility settings for the side button on an iPhone with Face ID. Choose the speed required to double-click or triple-click the button. Or use AssistiveTouch or Switch Control to confirm payments with Face ID instead of double-clicking the side button. You can also modify accessibility settings for Camera Control on iPhone. Change the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control or the speed required to lightly double-press it. Or adjust the gesture you use to access controls like Zoom or Depth.\n\n**Set up Touch Accommodations on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208433)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Touch Accommodations on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTOhANVkrA&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=6)\n- [How to reach the top of your iPhone screen with one hand, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bawpMvdXk8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=13)\n\n### Back Tap\n\nMeet the easiest shortcut ever.

Turn on Full Keyboard Access on Mac to navigate and control your Mac with only the keyboard. You can also change the appearance of the cursor — make the Full Keyboard Access cursor wider, or choose a color and increase contrast so it’s easier to spot on the screen.\n\nWith Key Repeat, you can set how long you must press and hold a key before it starts repeating and how fast it repeats once it starts. Or you can prevent the key from repeating at all. Slow Keys lets you adjust the amount of time between when a key is pressed and when it is activated, so your device processes only the keystrokes you mean to make. Sticky Keys enables you to enter key combinations sequentially rather than simultaneously. Or use Mouse Keys to control your pointer with a numeric keypad on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can also create custom shortcuts for commonly used words or phrases, and your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will type them for you.\n\n**Set up hardware keyboard support on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keyboards-ipha7c3927eb/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/keyboards-ipad424a3e13/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-keyboard-settings-for-accessibility-mchlae61a6de/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/control-your-device-with-an-external-keyboard-tan170e01fda/visionos)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Control iPhone with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-iphone-with-an-external-keyboard-ipha4375873f/ios)\n- [Control iPad with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/control-ipad-with-an-external-keyboard-ipad5f765d6f/ipados)\n- [Navigate your Mac using Full Keyboard Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/navigate-your-mac-using-full-keyboard-access-mchlc06d1059/mac)\n\nTouch settingsAccessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Accessibility Keyboard\n\nCustomize how you type on your Mac.\n\nRead more about Accessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Accessibility Keyboard\n\nThe customizable, onscreen Accessibility Keyboard lets you navigate and type in macOS without using a physical keyboard.

Designed with feedback from individuals with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters, Assistive Access offers a distinctive interface with high-contrast buttons, large text labels, and visual alternatives to text. It also has tools to help individuals and their supporters adjust the experience in specific apps.\n\nAssistive Access includes customized experiences for Phone and FaceTime (which have been combined into a single Calls app), Messages, Camera, Photos, Music, and Magnifier. For those who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message. Choose a more visual, grid-based layout for your Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout if you prefer text. Assistive Access also supports third-party apps, including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps.\n\n**Set up Assistive Access on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-ipad/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ipados)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Make calls with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/make-calls-devad3c7dd65/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Take photos and videos with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/take-photos-and-videos-dev4e133cf212/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Send messages with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/send-messages-deva0c04b931/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Play music with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/play-music-dev50df63992/18.0/ios/18.0)\n\nFitness appsApple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Apple Intelligence\n\nSupports effective written communication and improves reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nRead more about Apple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Apple Intelligence\n\nThere are many ways Apple Intelligence can help enhance your written communication, reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nTransform how you communicate with Writing Tools. Use them to proofread your text, rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize text with a tap. And in the Notes or Phone app, you can capture audio recordings and transcripts and then get a summary of your transcripts for easy reference later. Writing Tools are available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-9)\n\nApple Intelligence can also help you get through your inbox faster. Priority messages in Mail elevate time-sensitive messages to the top of your inbox, so you know what to read first when you open Mail. Brief summaries appear in the email preview and in the conversation list in Messages, so you know the key information before you even open the thread. And when you open an email thread in Mail, you can tap to see a summary that helps you get the gist of a lengthy email exchange. You can even quickly respond to messages in Mail and Messages with Smart Reply, which offers response options based on your conversation.\n\nWith the power of Apple Intelligence, your devices can understand the notifications you receive, summarize them, and organize them in a way that prioritizes what’s most important to you. Priority notifications appear at the top of the stack on your Lock Screen, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance. And notifications are summarized, so you can scan them faster, lightening your cognitive load.\n\nThere are countless ways Apple Intelligence can support people with cognitive challenges — all without compromising privacy.\n\n**Set up Apple Intelligence on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-iphc28624b81/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-ipade5045bb1/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-mchl46361784/mac)\n\nAssistive AccessBackground Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n### Background Sounds\n\nPlay calming sounds to help you focus or rest.\n\nRead more about Background Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n## Background Sounds\n\nBackground Sounds help minimize distractions and increase your sense of focus, calm, and restfulness to the tune of distant rain or ocean waves.

If you have strong verbal skills but your spelling or typing could use an assist, just go to any text field and tap the microphone button on the onscreen keyboard to start dictating. Or simply look at the microphone button in a search field and start speaking to dictate text on Apple Vision Pro. And you can activate Dictation through Keyboard settings on your Mac to turn your speech into text. Fluidly switch between voice and touch so you can continue to interact with your onscreen keyboard to move the cursor or insert QuickType suggestions.[40](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-40) Punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks are automatically added to your text as you speak.[41](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-41) You can even insert emoji into messages using just your voice.[42](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?speech#footnote-42)\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

And Focus filters help you set boundaries in Apple apps like Calendar and Messages, as well as third-party apps, by hiding distracting content. Choose a set of Tab Groups to show up in Safari while in the Work Focus, or hide your work calendar altogether when you’re using the Personal Focus.

VoiceOver is an industry‑leading screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your screen audibly, in braille, or both. Easily control and navigate your screen through simple gestures on a touchscreen, trackpad, or Bluetooth keyboard. On Apple Vision Pro, you can control and navigate your device with a combination of gestures using one or both hands. VoiceOver can describe your surroundings in great detail.

It uses the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of any physical object you point it at, like a menu or sign, so you can see all the details clearly on your screen. Use the flashlight or LED flash to light the object, adjust filters to help you differentiate colors, or freeze a specific frame to get a static close-up.\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Furniture Detection, Scenes, and Text Detection.[3](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-3) On iPhone you can use Detection Mode with the Action button to have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-4)\n\nIf there’s text on nearby physical objects, such as buttons on household appliances or labels on files, use Point and Speak to have it read aloud.[5](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-5) You can also use Reader Mode to view the text in a format that’s easier to read. Magnifier lets you temporarily capture a frame that contains text, so you can view it in a format adapted for easier reading and even adjust the font, size, and color of the text to your liking.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages.

Hear your entire screen read aloud with Speak Screen, and use Speech Controller to keep those controls onscreen so you can easily pause speaking, adjust the rate, or navigate forward or back to the content you want to hear. With Highlight Content, you can have words or sentences accentuated in a customized color and style as they’re read out loud.\n\nUse Speak Selection to have a specific range of text read to you. Or activate Typing Feedback to hear what you type spoken out loud character by character, word by word, with auto-corrections and auto-capitalizations as they appear.\n\nSpoken Content is available in over 80 distinct voices and more than 60 languages and locales, with options to customize settings such as pitch range for your preferred built-in voices.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-2) Languages are automatically detected to switch seamlessly between voices, so your spoken content won’t feel impersonal.\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Invert display colors, adjust transparency, modify how colors appear with color filters, and more.\n\nInvert display colors to make the background dark so text and content stand out. This can be useful in apps and websites that don’t support Dark Mode. Smart Invert reverses the colors on the display except for images, media, and some apps that use dark color styles, while Classic Invert reverses all colors on the display.\n\nColor filters let you view the entire screen in grayscale, adjust colors for color vision deficiencies, or tint the screen a color. Use Reduce White Point to tone down the intensity of bright colors. You can also make the display easier on your eyes as it gets dark out by turning on Night Shift, which automatically adjusts the colors of your display to the warmer end of the spectrum.\n\nSome backgrounds appear transparent or blurred by default. Turn on Reduce Transparency to make these backgrounds opaque by giving them a solid color and making them easier to see onscreen. You can also use Increase Contrast to turn up the color contrast between an app’s foreground and background colors.\n\nSome screen items rely on color to convey information. Use Differentiate Without Color to replace these with alternative ways to tell them apart, like shapes or text. Switches turn green when they are on. On/Off Labels adds a vertical line to switches to indicate when they’re on and a circle to indicate when they’re off. Turn on Button Shapes to underline any text that performs an action when you tap it, so it’s easier to identify these elements onscreen.\n\nText Size helps make text more legible and visible with simple font adjustments. With Larger Text you can adjust the size using an accessibility slider, while Bold Text gives weight to the words on your screen. Your preferred settings will be applied only to the apps you choose.\n\n**Set up Display settings on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e1fb0)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/change-display-colors-ipad674f91c0/18.0/ipados/18.0)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-display-colors-easier-onscreen-mchl11ddd4b3/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/adjust-text-size-and-other-visual-settings-apd766b7bd85/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvbf413b243/16.0/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/display-text-size-tan5b0340be2/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph53475523f)\n\n**Set up Text Size on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/customize-the-text-size-and-zoom-setting-iphd6804774e/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246013)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/make-text-and-icons-bigger-mchld786f2cd/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/adjust-text-size-and-other-visual-settings-apd766b7bd85/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/display-bold-text-atvb0222141c/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/adjust-text-display-settings-tan5b0340be2/visionos)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph53475523f)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to adjust text size on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R0mpzMkSjI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=15)\n- [How to customize accessibility settings app by app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sHaXuFb6uk&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=31)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Support for CarPlay.** Color filters and Bold Text help make your CarPlay screen easier to see.\n\n**Support for Apple Vision Pro.** Make it easier to see what’s in your field of view with Smart Color Invert and Reduce Transparency.\n\nSpoken ContentVehicle Motion Cues\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_dim_flashing_lights__fz37txo1m96y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Vehicle Motion Cues\n\nHelps passengers reduce motion sickness while using their device in a car.\n\nRead more about Vehicle Motion\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_dim_flashing_lights__fz37txo1m96y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Vehicle Motion Cues\n\nWhen you want to use iPhone or iPad while a passenger in a moving vehicle, Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness.[6](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-6) Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, dots appear on your screen and move with the motion of the vehicle to reduce sensory conflict — a common cause of motion sickness.

On HomePod, Sound Recognition can also detect the sound of a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm. Sound Recognition supports CarPlay, too. Your iPhone will listen for and detect sirens and horns.

With high-quality video and a fast frame rate, FaceTime ensures that you never miss a moment. Through Sign Language Prominence, FaceTime detects when you’re using sign language in Group FaceTime calls and automatically highlights your tile to make you prominent in the conversation. You can also use simple hand gestures to add a reaction that fills the camera frame with 3D augmented reality effects like hearts or confetti.[18](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-18)\n\nStaying connected is even easier with Live Captions in FaceTime, which can caption speech in one-on-one and Group FaceTime calls with speaker attribution, so you can easily track who is speaking during group calls.[12](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-12) And on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Live Speech integrates seamlessly with FaceTime — just type your responses and your device speaks them out loud to others on the call. Or quickly chime in with your favorite saved phrases during animated conversations.\n\n**Set up FaceTime on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph7801d5771)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad6b71e29e)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/facetime/get-started-with-facetime-on-mac-fctmb754bbc2/36/mac)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvb874c905e)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/make-or-receive-a-facetime-call-tan440238696/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Live Captions in FaceTime on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAQFeb2GfM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=21)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Live Captions in FaceTime for tvOS.** Read what others are saying on a FaceTime call from the biggest screen in the home.\n\nSound RecognitionSensory Alerts\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_audio_settings__f648ne7fney6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Sensory Alerts\n\nGet your notifications through sound, vibrations, a flashing light, or all three.\n\nRead more about Sensory Alerts\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_audio_settings__f648ne7fney6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Sensory Alerts\n\nYour device can alert you in a way you’ll notice. Choose visual or vibrating alerts for incoming Phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an LED light flash for incoming calls or have your iPhone display a photo of the caller. If you’re on your Mac, have it flash its screen when an app needs your attention. You can also turn on haptics to play when Face ID successfully unlocks, authorizes Apple Pay, or verifies a purchase.\n\nApple Watch lets you adjust the strength of the taps and vibrations that it uses for alerts and notifications. You can even add an extra haptic tap that pre-announces your other haptic alerts. Turn on Crown Haptics to get haptic feedback when you turn the Digital Crown to scroll.

In addition to transcribing speech in a scene, they capture nonverbal communication, music, and sound effects. Supported in apps like the Apple TV app, closed captions are available in more than 40 languages for movies, TV shows, videos, and podcasts — just look for the CC icon.

Apple Watch periodically measures the sound levels throughout the day while you’re wearing your watch. This uses the microphone but does not record or save any sounds. If the average sound level over three minutes reaches or exceeds a chosen decibel threshold, your Apple Watch can notify you.\n\nWhen you configure the Noise app on Apple Watch and connect compatible headphones, Control Center notifies you if the sounds playing through the headphones reach unsafe levels.[23](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-23) And all your information is stored in the Health app on iPhone for easy access to your data whenever you need it.\n\n**Set up Noise app on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209593)\n\nTranscriptionsSiri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Siri\n\nStreamline a series of tasks and ask Siri to do them for you by voice or by text.\n\nRead more about Siri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Siri\n\nUse voice or text to have Siri help you complete the tasks you do every day — or just answer questions you’re curious about.[24](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-24) Ask or use Type to Siri to find definitions, set reminders, turn features on or off, and more. If you need to streamline a series of actions or tasks, you can use Siri to run custom shortcuts through the Shortcuts app. Run your shortcut by saying “Hey Siri” or “Siri” and then the name of the shortcut you created.[25](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-25) Made for iPhone hearing devices can use Siri to announce notifications for iPhone and iPad. And if you’re using Safari Reader and want to hear text read out loud, just say “Siri, read this” when you’re browsing a Reader-compatible site. If you have a speech disability, Siri can listen for atypical speech. You can also customize the speed at which Siri speaks to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nCommunicating with Siri is even more natural thanks to richer language understanding from Apple Intelligence. If you change your mind mid-sentence, Siri can follow right along. For example, you might say “Siri, set an alarm — wait no, sorry, I meant a timer for 5 minutes — actually, let’s make that 10.” Siri Pause Time lets you adjust the amount of time Siri waits before responding, so you can speak comfortably at your own pace without worrying about being interrupted. And once you activate Siri, you can make multiple requests back to back without needing to say “Siri” repeatedly.[26](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-26)\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri can assist you in ways that are unique to you and can help reduce your cognitive load.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-9) Deeper product knowledge across thousands of topics enables Siri to give you step-by-step directions on how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Siri also maintains context so you can refer to something you mentioned in a previous request. For example, if you created a Calendar event, you can ask “What will the weather be like there?”\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Live Speech can help you generate real-time responses to stay connected during Phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. You can also save commonly used phrases to help you easily respond during daily interactions and conversations. For example, you can create a Coffee Shop category to group phrases you frequently use, such as “I’d like to order a tea” or “May I have cream and sugar with that?” Live Speech even allows the audio from apps to be audible in voice and video calls, which can be helpful if you use apps that assist with speaking and communication.\n\n**Set up Live Speech on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/type-to-speak-iphcf92d2d9b/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/type-to-speak-ipad32ad5293/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl86b6234f)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd86a007717/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/live-speech-tan9351d794e/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to set up and use Personal Voice and Live Speech on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRXswd7yaRk)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Categories for Live Speech.** Live Speech and Live Captions work together, and Live Speech offers the ability to group phrases into categories like Saved or Recent or user-generated categories like Food or School.\n\nSiriPersonal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Personal Voice\n\nCreate a voice that sounds like you.\n\nRead more about Personal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Personal Voice\n\nIf you are at risk of voice loss or have a condition that can progressively impact your voice, Personal Voice can help.

This feature uses on-device machine learning to keep your information private and secure. And Personal Voice seamlessly integrates with Live Speech, so you can type what you want to say and have your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch speak it aloud in the voice you created. Personal Voice also works with third-party augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps and other apps that you allow.\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Use the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate Eye Tracking in seconds. And thanks to on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on your device and isn’t shared with Apple. Eye Tracking works with iOS and iPadOS apps and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories.[35](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-35) To help you navigate through different apps, you can use Dwell Control, which enables you to interact with controls by keeping your eyes on them for a selected amount of time. And Eye Tracking lets you access additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes or even type using only your eyes. iPad also supports third-party eye trackers.\n\n**Set up Eye Tracking on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph66057d0f6)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad2cd35723)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to set up and use Eye Tracking on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8LimeLV_Kk&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=2&pp=iAQB)\n\nVoice ControlAlternative input\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_alternative_input__fpw4ej772u6i_large_2x.png)\n\n### Alternative input\n\nControl your device without using your hands or fingers.\n\nRead more about alternative input\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_alternative_input__fpw4ej772u6i_large_2x.png)\n\n## Alternative input\n\nThere are many ways to navigate and control your devices without using your hands or fingers. Head Tracking uses the camera on your device to follow the movement of your head to control a pointer on your screen, and it tracks your facial movements to perform actions.[36](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-36)\n\nPointer Control on Mac lets you use different methods, like head movements, to control your pointer and mouse or trackpad button. You can set options to specify the way the pointer moves, how fast it moves, which switches to use for head pointer actions, and which camera to use. Alternate pointer actions let you use keyboard shortcuts, assistive switches, or facial expressions to perform mouse actions, such as left, right, or double clicks or other custom actions to suit your needs.\n\n**Set up alternative input on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/move-the-pointer-using-head-pointer-mchlb2d4782b/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-pointer-to-navigate-tan3869c8a85/visionos)\n\nEye TrackingAssistiveTouch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nCustomize how you interact with your touchscreen.\n\nRead more about Assistive Touch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## AssistiveTouch\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nAssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS enables you to adapt your touchscreen to ﬁt your physical needs. If certain gestures, like pinch or two-finger tap, don’t work for you, swap them with a gesture that does or create a touch that’s all your own. You can also use AssistiveTouch to replace pressing buttons. You can customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu or connect a Bluetooth device to control an onscreen pointer for navigation. And with Virtual Trackpad on iPad, you can control your device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\nAssistiveTouch for Apple Watch helps those with upper-body limb differences use hand gestures such as clench, double clench, tap, and double tap to control apps and experiences across Apple Watch.[37](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-37) With the Motion Pointer, you can control your Apple Watch by tilting the watch up and down and side to side. Adjust Motion Pointer settings for sensitivity, activation time, movement tolerance, and hot edges.\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, you can assign gestures, such as single tap, double tap, or long press, that run custom actions when you interact with the AssistiveTouch menu button. You can also customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu and connect assistive pointer devices via Bluetooth, Lightning, USB, or USB‑C.\n\n**Set up AssistiveTouch on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-assistivetouch-tan4ddb28816/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use AssistiveTouch on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j4-NTg3QsE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=25&t=3s)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Virtual Trackpad.** If you have limited mobility, you can control your iPad using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\n### Quick Actions for Apple Watch\n\nMerge subtle movement with skillful multitasking through Quick Actions for Apple Watch. You can do even more with your Apple Watch without ever touching the display or turning on AssistiveTouch for Apple Watch. Double‑tap with your hand to easily answer a phone call, snap a photo, pause your music, resume your daily workout, and much more. You can find and enable Quick Actions in Accessibility settings on your Apple Watch.[38](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-38)\n\n**Set up Quick Actions for Apple Watch on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use AssistiveTouch on Apple Watch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=869--vIUIv4&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=12)\n\nAlternative inputTouch settings\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Touch settings\n\nAdjust how your devices respond to your touch.\n\nRead more about Touch Settings\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Touch settings\n\n### Touch Accommodations\n\nAdjust how the screen responds to your touch with Touch Accommodations. Control how long you touch before it’s recognized or whether repeat touches are ignored. With Tap Assistance, if you accidentally perform a swipe gesture, your device can determine whether your initial touch location or your final touch is read as your intended tap location. Enable Final Touch Location to put your ﬁnger down anywhere on the screen and move to the point where you want to tap before the timer is finished. When you use iPhone with one hand in portrait orientation, you can use Reachability to lower the top half of the screen so it’s within easy reach of your thumb.\n\nYou can adjust accessibility settings for the side button on an iPhone with Face ID. Choose the speed required to double-click or triple-click the button. Or use AssistiveTouch or Switch Control to confirm payments with Face ID instead of double-clicking the side button. You can also modify accessibility settings for Camera Control on iPhone. Change the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control or the speed required to lightly double-press it. Or adjust the gesture you use to access controls like Zoom or Depth.\n\n**Set up Touch Accommodations on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208433)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Touch Accommodations on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTOhANVkrA&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=6)\n- [How to reach the top of your iPhone screen with one hand, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bawpMvdXk8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=13)\n\n### Back Tap\n\nMeet the easiest shortcut ever. Back Tap lets you double‑tap or triple‑tap the back of your iPhone to perform actions like taking a screenshot, turning on an accessibility feature, or running a shortcut. Choose from more than 20 different actions or create your own automated shortcuts in the Shortcuts app to simplify your everyday tasks.[29](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-29)\n\n**Set up Back Tap on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-tap-iphaa57e7885/ios)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Use Shortcuts to automate tasks on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/shortcuts-iph47e1c9d7d/ios)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Back Tap on iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ZeFJ65iXc&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=16)\n\nAssistiveTouchHardware keyboard support\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Hardware keyboard support\n\nMakes typing easier with keyboard adjustments to fit your needs.\n\nRead more about Hardware Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Hardware keyboard support\n\nIf you use Magic Keyboard or another physical keyboard with your devices, you can adjust the sensitivity of keys and make it easier to press combinations of keys. Turn on Full Keyboard Access on Mac to navigate and control your Mac with only the keyboard. You can also change the appearance of the cursor — make the Full Keyboard Access cursor wider, or choose a color and increase contrast so it’s easier to spot on the screen.\n\nWith Key Repeat, you can set how long you must press and hold a key before it starts repeating and how fast it repeats once it starts. Or you can prevent the key from repeating at all. Slow Keys lets you adjust the amount of time between when a key is pressed and when it is activated, so your device processes only the keystrokes you mean to make. Sticky Keys enables you to enter key combinations sequentially rather than simultaneously. Or use Mouse Keys to control your pointer with a numeric keypad on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can also create custom shortcuts for commonly used words or phrases, and your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will type them for you.\n\n**Set up hardware keyboard support on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keyboards-ipha7c3927eb/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/keyboards-ipad424a3e13/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-keyboard-settings-for-accessibility-mchlae61a6de/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/control-your-device-with-an-external-keyboard-tan170e01fda/visionos)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Control iPhone with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-iphone-with-an-external-keyboard-ipha4375873f/ios)\n- [Control iPad with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/control-ipad-with-an-external-keyboard-ipad5f765d6f/ipados)\n- [Navigate your Mac using Full Keyboard Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/navigate-your-mac-using-full-keyboard-access-mchlc06d1059/mac)\n\nTouch settingsAccessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Accessibility Keyboard\n\nCustomize how you type on your Mac.\n\nRead more about Accessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Accessibility Keyboard\n\nThe customizable, onscreen Accessibility Keyboard lets you navigate and type in macOS without using a physical keyboard. It includes support for custom toolbars and improved typing with auto-capitalization and better word suggestions.

Designed with feedback from individuals with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters, Assistive Access offers a distinctive interface with high-contrast buttons, large text labels, and visual alternatives to text. It also has tools to help individuals and their supporters adjust the experience in specific apps.\n\nAssistive Access includes customized experiences for Phone and FaceTime (which have been combined into a single Calls app), Messages, Camera, Photos, Music, and Magnifier. For those who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message. Choose a more visual, grid-based layout for your Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout if you prefer text. Assistive Access also supports third-party apps, including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps.\n\n**Set up Assistive Access on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-ipad/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ipados)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Make calls with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/make-calls-devad3c7dd65/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Take photos and videos with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/take-photos-and-videos-dev4e133cf212/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Send messages with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/send-messages-deva0c04b931/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Play music with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/play-music-dev50df63992/18.0/ios/18.0)\n\nFitness appsApple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Apple Intelligence\n\nSupports effective written communication and improves reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nRead more about Apple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Apple Intelligence\n\nThere are many ways Apple Intelligence can help enhance your written communication, reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nTransform how you communicate with Writing Tools. Use them to proofread your text, rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize text with a tap. And in the Notes or Phone app, you can capture audio recordings and transcripts and then get a summary of your transcripts for easy reference later. Writing Tools are available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-9)\n\nApple Intelligence can also help you get through your inbox faster. Priority messages in Mail elevate time-sensitive messages to the top of your inbox, so you know what to read first when you open Mail. Brief summaries appear in the email preview and in the conversation list in Messages, so you know the key information before you even open the thread. And when you open an email thread in Mail, you can tap to see a summary that helps you get the gist of a lengthy email exchange. You can even quickly respond to messages in Mail and Messages with Smart Reply, which offers response options based on your conversation.\n\nWith the power of Apple Intelligence, your devices can understand the notifications you receive, summarize them, and organize them in a way that prioritizes what’s most important to you. Priority notifications appear at the top of the stack on your Lock Screen, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance. And notifications are summarized, so you can scan them faster, lightening your cognitive load.\n\nThere are countless ways Apple Intelligence can support people with cognitive challenges — all without compromising privacy.\n\n**Set up Apple Intelligence on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-iphc28624b81/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-ipade5045bb1/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-mchl46361784/mac)\n\nAssistive AccessBackground Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n### Background Sounds\n\nPlay calming sounds to help you focus or rest.\n\nRead more about Background Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n## Background Sounds\n\nBackground Sounds help minimize distractions and increase your sense of focus, calm, and restfulness to the tune of distant rain or ocean waves.

If you have strong verbal skills but your spelling or typing could use an assist, just go to any text field and tap the microphone button on the onscreen keyboard to start dictating. Or simply look at the microphone button in a search field and start speaking to dictate text on Apple Vision Pro. And you can activate Dictation through Keyboard settings on your Mac to turn your speech into text. Fluidly switch between voice and touch so you can continue to interact with your onscreen keyboard to move the cursor or insert QuickType suggestions.[40](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-40) Punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks are automatically added to your text as you speak.[41](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-41) You can even insert emoji into messages using just your voice.[42](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-42)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#dictation) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#dictation) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up Dictation on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/dictate-text-iph2c0651d2/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/dictate-text-ipad997d9642/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-dictation-mh40584/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/send-messages-apd92a90f882/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/activate-siri-search-or-dictation-atvb16053d68/18.0/tvos/18.0)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/enter-text-and-use-dictation-tana14220eef/visionos)\n\nGuided AccessFocus\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_focus__dppor8rlsqs2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Focus\n\nCustomize the notifications and calls you receive at specific times.\n\nRead more about Focus\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_focus__dppor8rlsqs2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Focus\n\nWith Focus, it’s even easier to home in on what’s most important to you. Activate different Focus areas like Do Not Disturb, Work, or Sleep to silence device notifications that may disturb or distract you in the moment. Reduce Interruptions understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention, like a text about picking up your child from daycare later today.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-43) A streamlined setup for Focus enables you to select the apps or people you want to receive notifications from by either allowing or silencing them.\n\nYou can connect your Lock Screen to your Focus of choice so the look and feel of your iPhone matches how you want to use it at that time — simply swipe to the corresponding Lock Screen to activate a Focus. And Focus filters help you set boundaries in Apple apps like Calendar and Messages, as well as third-party apps, by hiding distracting content. Choose a set of Tab Groups to show up in Safari while in the Work Focus, or hide your work calendar altogether when you’re using the Personal Focus. You can even set a Focus area to turn on at a certain time or location or when you’re using a specific app.\n\n**Set up Focus on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/set-up-a-focus-ipad2789d162/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-a-focus-to-stay-on-task-mchl613dc43f/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-focus-apd6640937c4/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/set-up-a-focus-tan025fade1f/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Reduce Interruptions.** This Focus area understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?mobility#footnote-43)\n\nDictation\n\n## Select any combination of accessibility categories, needs, and devices to help refine your results.\n\nFilter\n\nCategories\n(1)\n\nSelected: Mobility\n\nVisionHearingSpeechMobilityCognitive\n\nNeeds\n\n\nNo selections\n\nBlindnessLow VisionMotion SensitivityDeafnessHard of HearingAtypical SpeechNonspeakingAlternative InputDexterityLimb DifferenceComprehensionAttentionCommunication\n\nDevices\n\n\nNo selections\n\niPhoneiPadMacApple WatchApple TVHomePodApple Vision ProCarPlayHeadphones\n\nResetReset\n\n**13 results**\n\n**Selection**\n\nMobility\n\n- ## Vision\n\n\n\nThese features can help you navigate your surroundings, control your devices, or customize your display if you’re blind, have low vision, or just prefer larger text.\n\n\n\n![Person with low vision wearing AirPods and walking with service dog](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/features/header_vision__dv5w4rabxawm_large_2x.png)![Person with low vision wearing AirPods and walking with service dog](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/features/header_vision_dark__cflwvyxvg56q_large_2x.png)\n\n\n  -

Voiceover\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_voiceover__fd6trvpl5nmi_large_2x.png)\n\n## VoiceOver\n\n### VoiceOver\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver is an industry‑leading screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your screen audibly, in braille, or both. Easily control and navigate your screen through simple gestures on a touchscreen, trackpad, or Bluetooth keyboard. On Apple Vision Pro, you can control and navigate your device with a combination of gestures using one or both hands. VoiceOver can describe your surroundings in great detail. With Live Recognition, you’ll get descriptions of objects in the real world, such as people, doors, text, and furniture in indoor spaces.[1](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-1) VoiceOver offers deep customization options, like modifying your favorite built-in voice for speech feedback and tailoring its verbosity, speed, and accompanying sound and haptic feedback to your preferences.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-2)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-voiceover) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#accessibility-voice-over-live-speech-spoken-content) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up VoiceOver on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246898/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/get-started-vo4be8816d70/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apdaabc79d3b/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvbfa4ff6cd/tvos)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/105025)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-tanae5174040/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to navigate your iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROIe49kXOc8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=5)\n- [How to hear image descriptions in the Camera app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnoeaUpHKxY&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=38)\n- [How to organize apps with the VoiceOver rotor on your iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Ds-I2L6PI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=47)\n- [How to choose a new voice for VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ols9d9urQ&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=47)\n- [How to customize VoiceOver pronunciation on your iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLbZ2F_V6U&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=40)\n- [How to turn on Emoji Suffix with VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHNyn_fU8Q&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=28)\n- [How to use Screen Curtain with VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCHdVdocouw&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=42)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**New voices and more.** For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver includes new voices, a flexible voice rotor, independent volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac.\n\n**Live Recognition.** Quickly get descriptions of objects in the real world, such as people, doors, text, and furniture in indoor spaces.[1](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-1)\n\n### VoiceOver + braille\n\nYou can also connect a Bluetooth wireless refreshable braille display and use it to control and navigate your Apple device. Read and type using contracted or uncontracted braille, or enter braille directly on the touchscreen using Braille Screen Input. VoiceOver supports many international braille tables. When communicating or working with sighted individuals, you can turn on the braille panel to display a language translation of the braille onscreen. Apple devices also support multiline text braille displays. With more than 70 refreshable braille displays compatible with iOS and iPadOS, and more than 100 with macOS, you can find the right braille experience for you.\n\n**Set up VoiceOver + braille on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-a-braille-display-iph73b8c43/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-a-braille-display-ipad9a246499/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/use-braille-displays-with-voiceover-vo15607/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-a-braille-display-apd1ffb55927/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/use-a-braille-display-atvb8e5f5efd/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-braille-display-tan4dde8f844/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Common braille commands for VoiceOver on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118665)\n- [Braille displays supported by iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/103246)\n- [Braille displays supported by Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109500)\n- [USB and Bluetooth braille displays supported by macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/supported-displays-cpvobrailledisplays/mac)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Support for multiline braille.** An industry first, your Apple devices support multiline text braille displays.\n\n**Braille Screen Input updates.** You can quickly enter and exit Braille Screen Input with new gestures.

It uses the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of any physical object you point it at, like a menu or sign, so you can see all the details clearly on your screen. Use the flashlight or LED flash to light the object, adjust filters to help you differentiate colors, or freeze a specific frame to get a static close-up.\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Furniture Detection, Scenes, and Text Detection.[3](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-3) On iPhone you can use Detection Mode with the Action button to have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-4)\n\nIf there’s text on nearby physical objects, such as buttons on household appliances or labels on files, use Point and Speak to have it read aloud.[5](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-5) You can also use Reader Mode to view the text in a format that’s easier to read. Magnifier lets you temporarily capture a frame that contains text, so you can view it in a format adapted for easier reading and even adjust the font, size, and color of the text to your liking.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-image-descriptions) for Scenes in Detection Mode availability. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-text-detection) for Text Detection availability.\n\n**Set up Magnifier on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphe867dc99c)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-ipad-like-a-magnifying-glass-ipadd86f5027/ipados)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [A tip for using Magnifier on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqrhEDtL1mI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=23)\n- [How to use Point and Speak on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPt34n3aAM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=9)\n- [How to use Detection Mode in Magnifier on iPhone or iPad with LiDAR, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI0KrPmS-DI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=20&t=3s)\n- [How to use People Detection on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyzkIhNIhgE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=41)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Reader Mode.** Magnifier offers a Reader Mode that can display a text image in a format for easy reading, with customizations such as adjusting the font, font size, or background color.\n\n**Detection Mode with Action button.** Detection Mode enables you to quickly and seamlessly find information about the real world. And on iPhone you can use the Action button to describe scenes. Just press the button and have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-4)\n\nVoiceOverSpoken Content\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_spoken_content__gdfl7nas1mq2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Spoken Content\n\nReads any text on your screen aloud, including letters and words as you type.\n\nRead more about Spoken Content\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_spoken_content__gdfl7nas1mq2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Spoken Content\n\nSpoken Content includes a collection of features designed to enhance your reading or writing with audio. Hear your entire screen read aloud with Speak Screen, and use Speech Controller to keep those controls onscreen so you can easily pause speaking, adjust the rate, or navigate forward or back to the content you want to hear. With Highlight Content, you can have words or sentences accentuated in a customized color and style as they’re read out loud.\n\nUse Speak Selection to have a specific range of text read to you. Or activate Typing Feedback to hear what you type spoken out loud character by character, word by word, with auto-corrections and auto-capitalizations as they appear.\n\nSpoken Content is available in over 80 distinct voices and more than 60 languages and locales, with options to customize settings such as pitch range for your preferred built-in voices.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-2) Languages are automatically detected to switch seamlessly between voices, so your spoken content won’t feel impersonal.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-voiceover) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#accessibility-voice-over-live-speech-spoken-content) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up Spoken Content on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/spoken-content-iph96b214f0/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/spoken-content-ipad9a247097/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/have-your-mac-speak-text-thats-on-the-screen-mh27448/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/hear-whats-in-your-view-or-typed-tanbe9d2c86c/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to have your iPhone or iPad read text to you, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV4cM34X7oo&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=14)\n- [How to use Speak Screen on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBfcPu61nSI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=32)\n- [How to set up Speak Selection on Mac, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZzm24uSsE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=34)\n- [How to have your iPhone or iPad speak each word as you type, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtOHo-aYSRM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=46)\n\nMagnifierDisplay settings & Text Size\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_display_settings__elym9ufaj6y6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Display settings & Text Size\n\nInvert colors, apply color filters, increase contrast, adjust text size, and more.\n\nRead more about Display Settings\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_display_settings__elym9ufaj6y6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Display settings & Text Size\n\nYou can customize your Display settings to make it easier to see what’s on your device screen. Invert display colors, adjust transparency, modify how colors appear with color filters, and more.\n\nInvert display colors to make the background dark so text and content stand out. This can be useful in apps and websites that don’t support Dark Mode. Smart Invert reverses the colors on the display except for images, media, and some apps that use dark color styles, while Classic Invert reverses all colors on the display.\n\nColor filters let you view the entire screen in grayscale, adjust colors for color vision deficiencies, or tint the screen a color. Use Reduce White Point to tone down the intensity of bright colors. You can also make the display easier on your eyes as it gets dark out by turning on Night Shift, which automatically adjusts the colors of your display to the warmer end of the spectrum.\n\nSome backgrounds appear transparent or blurred by default. Turn on Reduce Transparency to make these backgrounds opaque by giving them a solid color and making them easier to see onscreen. You can also use Increase Contrast to turn up the color contrast between an app’s foreground and background colors.\n\nSome screen items rely on color to convey information. Use Differentiate Without Color to replace these with alternative ways to tell them apart, like shapes or text. Switches turn green when they are on. On/Off Labels adds a vertical line to switches to indicate when they’re on and a circle to indicate when they’re off. Turn on Button Shapes to underline any text that performs an action when you tap it, so it’s easier to identify these elements onscreen.\n\nText Size helps make text more legible and visible with simple font adjustments. With Larger Text you can adjust the size using an accessibility slider, while Bold Text gives weight to the words on your screen.

Choose Full Screen Zoom to magnify the entire screen, or Window Zoom to magnify only part of the screen with a resizable lens.[8](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-8) Follow Focus tracks your selections, the text insertion point, and your typing. Smart Typing magnifies the text area and keeps the keyboard unmagnified while typing. With Zoom Filters, you can apply Inverted, Grayscale, Grayscale Inverted, or Low Light to the magnified area.\n\nZoom also works with VoiceOver, so you can more clearly see and hear what’s happening on your screen. Split-screen zoom on Mac lets you see content up close and at a distance simultaneously.

Shortcuts for features like VoiceOver and AssistiveTouch let you quickly toggle them on and off. If you have short-term memory loss, you can use Remember This to log what happens throughout the day. Or run the In Case of Emergency shortcut to send your location to your chosen emergency contacts, share a message with custom instructions, and display a message of your choice onscreen for first responders to see.\n\nThe Accessibility Assistant shortcut can help you find built-in accessibility features that work for you. Answer a series of questions about your needs, and the Accessibility Assistant will create a Notes document with a list of recommended accessibility features and relevant Apple Support links.

Just turn on the feature and move your device toward the people who are speaking. Audio is picked up by the device’s microphone and sent to your AirPods, Beats headphones, or Made for iPhone hearing devices, so you can hear what’s being said more clearly.[16](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-16)\n\n**Set up Live Listen on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/live-listen-iph8bf9386f5/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/live-listen-ipad85f8f503/ipados)\n- [AirPods Max](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [AirPods Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [AirPods](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Powerbeats Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Beats Fit Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Made for iPhone hearing devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203990)\n\nAudio settingsSound Recognition\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_sound_recognition__cwya9s0nxjee_large_2x.png)\n\n### Sound Recognition\n\nListens for specific sounds and notifies you when they are detected.\n\nRead more about Sound Recognition\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_sound_recognition__cwya9s0nxjee_large_2x.png)\n\n## Sound Recognition\n\nSound Recognition listens for certain sounds and uses on‑device intelligence to notify you when they are detected. This feature recognizes 15 different sounds — or you can train your device to listen for electronic sounds that are unique to your environment, like the beeping of appliances in your kitchen, specific types of alarms, or doorbells. On HomePod, Sound Recognition can also detect the sound of a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm. Sound Recognition supports CarPlay, too. Your iPhone will listen for and detect sirens and horns. You’ll receive a notification — onscreen in your car if you’re using CarPlay — when a particular sound is detected.[17](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-17)\n\n**Set up Sound Recognition on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/sound-recognition-iphf2dc33312/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/sound-recognition-ipad6c28ec42/ipados)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/alerts-smoke-carbon-monoxide-detectors-apd1f1921722/homepod)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/sound-recognition-tan1e32c7922/visionos)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphac8c5db30)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Sound Recognition on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9Xsw5Aa5w&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=39)\n- [How to add custom sounds to Sound Recognition on iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_pTguuSA4o&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=18)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Support for CarPlay.** Sound Recognition is compatible with CarPlay.

With high-quality video and a fast frame rate, FaceTime ensures that you never miss a moment. Through Sign Language Prominence, FaceTime detects when you’re using sign language in Group FaceTime calls and automatically highlights your tile to make you prominent in the conversation. You can also use simple hand gestures to add a reaction that fills the camera frame with 3D augmented reality effects like hearts or confetti.[18](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-18)\n\nStaying connected is even easier with Live Captions in FaceTime, which can caption speech in one-on-one and Group FaceTime calls with speaker attribution, so you can easily track who is speaking during group calls.[12](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-12) And on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Live Speech integrates seamlessly with FaceTime — just type your responses and your device speaks them out loud to others on the call.

Choose visual or vibrating alerts for incoming Phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an LED light flash for incoming calls or have your iPhone display a photo of the caller. If you’re on your Mac, have it flash its screen when an app needs your attention. You can also turn on haptics to play when Face ID successfully unlocks, authorizes Apple Pay, or verifies a purchase.\n\nApple Watch lets you adjust the strength of the taps and vibrations that it uses for alerts and notifications. You can even add an extra haptic tap that pre-announces your other haptic alerts. Turn on Crown Haptics to get haptic feedback when you turn the Digital Crown to scroll.

Apple Watch periodically measures the sound levels throughout the day while you’re wearing your watch. This uses the microphone but does not record or save any sounds. If the average sound level over three minutes reaches or exceeds a chosen decibel threshold, your Apple Watch can notify you.\n\nWhen you configure the Noise app on Apple Watch and connect compatible headphones, Control Center notifies you if the sounds playing through the headphones reach unsafe levels.[23](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-23) And all your information is stored in the Health app on iPhone for easy access to your data whenever you need it.\n\n**Set up Noise app on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209593)\n\nTranscriptionsSiri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Siri\n\nStreamline a series of tasks and ask Siri to do them for you by voice or by text.\n\nRead more about Siri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Siri\n\nUse voice or text to have Siri help you complete the tasks you do every day — or just answer questions you’re curious about.[24](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-24) Ask or use Type to Siri to find definitions, set reminders, turn features on or off, and more. If you need to streamline a series of actions or tasks, you can use Siri to run custom shortcuts through the Shortcuts app. Run your shortcut by saying “Hey Siri” or “Siri” and then the name of the shortcut you created.[25](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-25) Made for iPhone hearing devices can use Siri to announce notifications for iPhone and iPad. And if you’re using Safari Reader and want to hear text read out loud, just say “Siri, read this” when you’re browsing a Reader-compatible site. If you have a speech disability, Siri can listen for atypical speech. You can also customize the speed at which Siri speaks to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nCommunicating with Siri is even more natural thanks to richer language understanding from Apple Intelligence. If you change your mind mid-sentence, Siri can follow right along. For example, you might say “Siri, set an alarm — wait no, sorry, I meant a timer for 5 minutes — actually, let’s make that 10.” Siri Pause Time lets you adjust the amount of time Siri waits before responding, so you can speak comfortably at your own pace without worrying about being interrupted. And once you activate Siri, you can make multiple requests back to back without needing to say “Siri” repeatedly.[26](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-26)\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri can assist you in ways that are unique to you and can help reduce your cognitive load.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-9) Deeper product knowledge across thousands of topics enables Siri to give you step-by-step directions on how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Siri also maintains context so you can refer to something you mentioned in a previous request. For example, if you created a Calendar event, you can ask “What will the weather be like there?”\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Use the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate Eye Tracking in seconds. And thanks to on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on your device and isn’t shared with Apple. Eye Tracking works with iOS and iPadOS apps and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories.[35](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-35) To help you navigate through different apps, you can use Dwell Control, which enables you to interact with controls by keeping your eyes on them for a selected amount of time.

Head Tracking uses the camera on your device to follow the movement of your head to control a pointer on your screen, and it tracks your facial movements to perform actions.[36](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-36)\n\nPointer Control on Mac lets you use different methods, like head movements, to control your pointer and mouse or trackpad button. You can set options to specify the way the pointer moves, how fast it moves, which switches to use for head pointer actions, and which camera to use. Alternate pointer actions let you use keyboard shortcuts, assistive switches, or facial expressions to perform mouse actions, such as left, right, or double clicks or other custom actions to suit your needs.\n\n**Set up alternative input on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/move-the-pointer-using-head-pointer-mchlb2d4782b/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-pointer-to-navigate-tan3869c8a85/visionos)\n\nEye TrackingAssistiveTouch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nCustomize how you interact with your touchscreen.\n\nRead more about Assistive Touch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## AssistiveTouch\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nAssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS enables you to adapt your touchscreen to ﬁt your physical needs. If certain gestures, like pinch or two-finger tap, don’t work for you, swap them with a gesture that does or create a touch that’s all your own. You can also use AssistiveTouch to replace pressing buttons. You can customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu or connect a Bluetooth device to control an onscreen pointer for navigation. And with Virtual Trackpad on iPad, you can control your device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\nAssistiveTouch for Apple Watch helps those with upper-body limb differences use hand gestures such as clench, double clench, tap, and double tap to control apps and experiences across Apple Watch.[37](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-37) With the Motion Pointer, you can control your Apple Watch by tilting the watch up and down and side to side. Adjust Motion Pointer settings for sensitivity, activation time, movement tolerance, and hot edges.\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, you can assign gestures, such as single tap, double tap, or long press, that run custom actions when you interact with the AssistiveTouch menu button.

Control how long you touch before it’s recognized or whether repeat touches are ignored. With Tap Assistance, if you accidentally perform a swipe gesture, your device can determine whether your initial touch location or your final touch is read as your intended tap location. Enable Final Touch Location to put your ﬁnger down anywhere on the screen and move to the point where you want to tap before the timer is finished. When you use iPhone with one hand in portrait orientation, you can use Reachability to lower the top half of the screen so it’s within easy reach of your thumb.\n\nYou can adjust accessibility settings for the side button on an iPhone with Face ID. Choose the speed required to double-click or triple-click the button. Or use AssistiveTouch or Switch Control to confirm payments with Face ID instead of double-clicking the side button. You can also modify accessibility settings for Camera Control on iPhone. Change the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control or the speed required to lightly double-press it. Or adjust the gesture you use to access controls like Zoom or Depth.\n\n**Set up Touch Accommodations on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208433)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Touch Accommodations on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTOhANVkrA&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=6)\n- [How to reach the top of your iPhone screen with one hand, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bawpMvdXk8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=13)\n\n### Back Tap\n\nMeet the easiest shortcut ever.

Or you can prevent the key from repeating at all. Slow Keys lets you adjust the amount of time between when a key is pressed and when it is activated, so your device processes only the keystrokes you mean to make. Sticky Keys enables you to enter key combinations sequentially rather than simultaneously. Or use Mouse Keys to control your pointer with a numeric keypad on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can also create custom shortcuts for commonly used words or phrases, and your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will type them for you.\n\n**Set up hardware keyboard support on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keyboards-ipha7c3927eb/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/keyboards-ipad424a3e13/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-keyboard-settings-for-accessibility-mchlae61a6de/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/control-your-device-with-an-external-keyboard-tan170e01fda/visionos)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Control iPhone with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-iphone-with-an-external-keyboard-ipha4375873f/ios)\n- [Control iPad with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/control-ipad-with-an-external-keyboard-ipad5f765d6f/ipados)\n- [Navigate your Mac using Full Keyboard Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/navigate-your-mac-using-full-keyboard-access-mchlc06d1059/mac)\n\nTouch settingsAccessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Accessibility Keyboard\n\nCustomize how you type on your Mac.\n\nRead more about Accessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Accessibility Keyboard\n\nThe customizable, onscreen Accessibility Keyboard lets you navigate and type in macOS without using a physical keyboard.

Designed with feedback from individuals with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters, Assistive Access offers a distinctive interface with high-contrast buttons, large text labels, and visual alternatives to text. It also has tools to help individuals and their supporters adjust the experience in specific apps.\n\nAssistive Access includes customized experiences for Phone and FaceTime (which have been combined into a single Calls app), Messages, Camera, Photos, Music, and Magnifier. For those who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message. Choose a more visual, grid-based layout for your Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout if you prefer text. Assistive Access also supports third-party apps, including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps.\n\n**Set up Assistive Access on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-ipad/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ipados)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Make calls with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/make-calls-devad3c7dd65/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Take photos and videos with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/take-photos-and-videos-dev4e133cf212/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Send messages with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/send-messages-deva0c04b931/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Play music with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/play-music-dev50df63992/18.0/ios/18.0)\n\nFitness appsApple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Apple Intelligence\n\nSupports effective written communication and improves reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nRead more about Apple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Apple Intelligence\n\nThere are many ways Apple Intelligence can help enhance your written communication, reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nTransform how you communicate with Writing Tools. Use them to proofread your text, rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize text with a tap. And in the Notes or Phone app, you can capture audio recordings and transcripts and then get a summary of your transcripts for easy reference later. Writing Tools are available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-9)\n\nApple Intelligence can also help you get through your inbox faster. Priority messages in Mail elevate time-sensitive messages to the top of your inbox, so you know what to read first when you open Mail. Brief summaries appear in the email preview and in the conversation list in Messages, so you know the key information before you even open the thread. And when you open an email thread in Mail, you can tap to see a summary that helps you get the gist of a lengthy email exchange. You can even quickly respond to messages in Mail and Messages with Smart Reply, which offers response options based on your conversation.\n\nWith the power of Apple Intelligence, your devices can understand the notifications you receive, summarize them, and organize them in a way that prioritizes what’s most important to you. Priority notifications appear at the top of the stack on your Lock Screen, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance. And notifications are summarized, so you can scan them faster, lightening your cognitive load.\n\nThere are countless ways Apple Intelligence can support people with cognitive challenges — all without compromising privacy.\n\n**Set up Apple Intelligence on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-iphc28624b81/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-ipade5045bb1/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-mchl46361784/mac)\n\nAssistive AccessBackground Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n### Background Sounds\n\nPlay calming sounds to help you focus or rest.\n\nRead more about Background Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n## Background Sounds\n\nBackground Sounds help minimize distractions and increase your sense of focus, calm, and restfulness to the tune of distant rain or ocean waves. Choose from balanced, bright, and dark noise and ocean, rain, and stream sounds to continuously play in the background and mask excess environmental or external noise.

For compatible sites in Safari that offer Reader view, simply tap Listen to Page in the Page Settings menu or say “Siri, read this.” And with the redesigned Safari Reader, you can get the gist of an article with a high-level summary and table of contents.[39](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-39)\n\n**Set up Safari Reader on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/hide-ads-and-distractions-iphdc30e3b86/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/hide-ads-and-distractions-ipad0669fc3c/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/hide-ads-when-reading-sfri32632/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/browse-the-web-tan714802d1a/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Redesigned Safari Reader.** With the smarter Safari Reader, get the gist of an article with a high-level summary and table of contents.[39](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-39)\n\nBackground SoundsGuided Access\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_guided_access__c85b5eedn6c2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Guided Access\n\nLimit app access and help reduce distractions.\n\nRead more about Guided Access\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_guided_access__c85b5eedn6c2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Guided Access\n\nWith Guided Access, you can temporarily restrict iPhone to a single app. This can be useful when you let a child use your iPhone or when you want to stay focused on a task. You can set a time limit and customize which features, hardware buttons, and areas of the screen are available. You can even restrict access to the keyboard, disable touch input on certain areas of the screen on iPhone or iPad, and disable all areas of view on Apple Vision Pro where an accidental gesture might cause a distraction.

If you have strong verbal skills but your spelling or typing could use an assist, just go to any text field and tap the microphone button on the onscreen keyboard to start dictating. Or simply look at the microphone button in a search field and start speaking to dictate text on Apple Vision Pro. And you can activate Dictation through Keyboard settings on your Mac to turn your speech into text. Fluidly switch between voice and touch so you can continue to interact with your onscreen keyboard to move the cursor or insert QuickType suggestions.[40](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-40) Punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks are automatically added to your text as you speak.[41](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-41) You can even insert emoji into messages using just your voice.[42](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-42)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages.

Activate different Focus areas like Do Not Disturb, Work, or Sleep to silence device notifications that may disturb or distract you in the moment. Reduce Interruptions understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention, like a text about picking up your child from daycare later today.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?hearing#footnote-43) A streamlined setup for Focus enables you to select the apps or people you want to receive notifications from by either allowing or silencing them.\n\nYou can connect your Lock Screen to your Focus of choice so the look and feel of your iPhone matches how you want to use it at that time — simply swipe to the corresponding Lock Screen to activate a Focus. And Focus filters help you set boundaries in Apple apps like Calendar and Messages, as well as third-party apps, by hiding distracting content. Choose a set of Tab Groups to show up in Safari while in the Work Focus, or hide your work calendar altogether when you’re using the Personal Focus.

Voiceover\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_voiceover__fd6trvpl5nmi_large_2x.png)\n\n## VoiceOver\n\n### VoiceOver\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver is an industry‑leading screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your screen audibly, in braille, or both. Easily control and navigate your screen through simple gestures on a touchscreen, trackpad, or Bluetooth keyboard. On Apple Vision Pro, you can control and navigate your device with a combination of gestures using one or both hands. VoiceOver can describe your surroundings in great detail. With Live Recognition, you’ll get descriptions of objects in the real world, such as people, doors, text, and furniture in indoor spaces.[1](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-1) VoiceOver offers deep customization options, like modifying your favorite built-in voice for speech feedback and tailoring its verbosity, speed, and accompanying sound and haptic feedback to your preferences.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-2)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-voiceover) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#accessibility-voice-over-live-speech-spoken-content) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up VoiceOver on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246898/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/get-started-vo4be8816d70/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apdaabc79d3b/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvbfa4ff6cd/tvos)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/105025)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-tanae5174040/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to navigate your iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROIe49kXOc8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=5)\n- [How to hear image descriptions in the Camera app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnoeaUpHKxY&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=38)\n- [How to organize apps with the VoiceOver rotor on your iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Ds-I2L6PI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=47)\n- [How to choose a new voice for VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ols9d9urQ&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=47)\n- [How to customize VoiceOver pronunciation on your iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLbZ2F_V6U&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=40)\n- [How to turn on Emoji Suffix with VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHNyn_fU8Q&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=28)\n- [How to use Screen Curtain with VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCHdVdocouw&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=42)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**New voices and more.** For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver includes new voices, a flexible voice rotor, independent volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac.\n\n**Live Recognition.** Quickly get descriptions of objects in the real world, such as people, doors, text, and furniture in indoor spaces.[1](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-1)\n\n### VoiceOver + braille\n\nYou can also connect a Bluetooth wireless refreshable braille display and use it to control and navigate your Apple device. Read and type using contracted or uncontracted braille, or enter braille directly on the touchscreen using Braille Screen Input. VoiceOver supports many international braille tables. When communicating or working with sighted individuals, you can turn on the braille panel to display a language translation of the braille onscreen. Apple devices also support multiline text braille displays. With more than 70 refreshable braille displays compatible with iOS and iPadOS, and more than 100 with macOS, you can find the right braille experience for you.\n\n**Set up VoiceOver + braille on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-a-braille-display-iph73b8c43/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-a-braille-display-ipad9a246499/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/use-braille-displays-with-voiceover-vo15607/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-a-braille-display-apd1ffb55927/watchos)\n- [Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/use-a-braille-display-atvb8e5f5efd/tvos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-braille-display-tan4dde8f844/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Common braille commands for VoiceOver on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118665)\n- [Braille displays supported by iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/103246)\n- [Braille displays supported by Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109500)\n- [USB and Bluetooth braille displays supported by macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/supported-displays-cpvobrailledisplays/mac)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Support for multiline braille.** An industry first, your Apple devices support multiline text braille displays.\n\n**Braille Screen Input updates.** You can quickly enter and exit Braille Screen Input with new gestures.

It uses the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of any physical object you point it at, like a menu or sign, so you can see all the details clearly on your screen. Use the flashlight or LED flash to light the object, adjust filters to help you differentiate colors, or freeze a specific frame to get a static close-up.\n\nFor those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Furniture Detection, Scenes, and Text Detection.[3](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-3) On iPhone you can use Detection Mode with the Action button to have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-4)\n\nIf there’s text on nearby physical objects, such as buttons on household appliances or labels on files, use Point and Speak to have it read aloud.[5](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-5) You can also use Reader Mode to view the text in a format that’s easier to read. Magnifier lets you temporarily capture a frame that contains text, so you can view it in a format adapted for easier reading and even adjust the font, size, and color of the text to your liking.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-image-descriptions) for Scenes in Detection Mode availability. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-text-detection) for Text Detection availability.\n\n**Set up Magnifier on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphe867dc99c)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-ipad-like-a-magnifying-glass-ipadd86f5027/ipados)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [A tip for using Magnifier on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqrhEDtL1mI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=23)\n- [How to use Point and Speak on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPt34n3aAM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=9)\n- [How to use Detection Mode in Magnifier on iPhone or iPad with LiDAR, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI0KrPmS-DI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=20&t=3s)\n- [How to use People Detection on iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyzkIhNIhgE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=41)\n\n**Updates:**\n\n**Reader Mode.** Magnifier offers a Reader Mode that can display a text image in a format for easy reading, with customizations such as adjusting the font, font size, or background color.\n\n**Detection Mode with Action button.** Detection Mode enables you to quickly and seamlessly find information about the real world. And on iPhone you can use the Action button to describe scenes. Just press the button and have your surroundings described to you.[4](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-4)\n\nVoiceOverSpoken Content\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_spoken_content__gdfl7nas1mq2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Spoken Content\n\nReads any text on your screen aloud, including letters and words as you type.\n\nRead more about Spoken Content\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_spoken_content__gdfl7nas1mq2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Spoken Content\n\nSpoken Content includes a collection of features designed to enhance your reading or writing with audio. Hear your entire screen read aloud with Speak Screen, and use Speech Controller to keep those controls onscreen so you can easily pause speaking, adjust the rate, or navigate forward or back to the content you want to hear. With Highlight Content, you can have words or sentences accentuated in a customized color and style as they’re read out loud.\n\nUse Speak Selection to have a specific range of text read to you. Or activate Typing Feedback to hear what you type spoken out loud character by character, word by word, with auto-corrections and auto-capitalizations as they appear.\n\nSpoken Content is available in over 80 distinct voices and more than 60 languages and locales, with options to customize settings such as pitch range for your preferred built-in voices.[2](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-2) Languages are automatically detected to switch seamlessly between voices, so your spoken content won’t feel impersonal.\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages. See [iOS and iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#accessibility-voiceover) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#accessibility-voice-over-live-speech-spoken-content) for feature availability.\n\n**Set up Spoken Content on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/spoken-content-iph96b214f0/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/spoken-content-ipad9a247097/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/have-your-mac-speak-text-thats-on-the-screen-mh27448/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/hear-whats-in-your-view-or-typed-tanbe9d2c86c/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to have your iPhone or iPad read text to you, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV4cM34X7oo&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=14)\n- [How to use Speak Screen on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBfcPu61nSI&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=32)\n- [How to set up Speak Selection on Mac, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZzm24uSsE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=34)\n- [How to have your iPhone or iPad speak each word as you type, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtOHo-aYSRM&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=46)\n\nMagnifierDisplay settings & Text Size\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_display_settings__elym9ufaj6y6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Display settings & Text Size\n\nInvert colors, apply color filters, increase contrast, adjust text size, and more.\n\nRead more about Display Settings\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_display_settings__elym9ufaj6y6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Display settings & Text Size\n\nYou can customize your Display settings to make it easier to see what’s on your device screen. Invert display colors, adjust transparency, modify how colors appear with color filters, and more.\n\nInvert display colors to make the background dark so text and content stand out. This can be useful in apps and websites that don’t support Dark Mode. Smart Invert reverses the colors on the display except for images, media, and some apps that use dark color styles, while Classic Invert reverses all colors on the display.\n\nColor filters let you view the entire screen in grayscale, adjust colors for color vision deficiencies, or tint the screen a color. Use Reduce White Point to tone down the intensity of bright colors. You can also make the display easier on your eyes as it gets dark out by turning on Night Shift, which automatically adjusts the colors of your display to the warmer end of the spectrum.\n\nSome backgrounds appear transparent or blurred by default. Turn on Reduce Transparency to make these backgrounds opaque by giving them a solid color and making them easier to see onscreen. You can also use Increase Contrast to turn up the color contrast between an app’s foreground and background colors.\n\nSome screen items rely on color to convey information. Use Differentiate Without Color to replace these with alternative ways to tell them apart, like shapes or text. Switches turn green when they are on. On/Off Labels adds a vertical line to switches to indicate when they’re on and a circle to indicate when they’re off. Turn on Button Shapes to underline any text that performs an action when you tap it, so it’s easier to identify these elements onscreen.\n\nText Size helps make text more legible and visible with simple font adjustments. With Larger Text you can adjust the size using an accessibility slider, while Bold Text gives weight to the words on your screen.

Choose Full Screen Zoom to magnify the entire screen, or Window Zoom to magnify only part of the screen with a resizable lens.[8](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-8) Follow Focus tracks your selections, the text insertion point, and your typing. Smart Typing magnifies the text area and keeps the keyboard unmagnified while typing. With Zoom Filters, you can apply Inverted, Grayscale, Grayscale Inverted, or Low Light to the magnified area.\n\nZoom also works with VoiceOver, so you can more clearly see and hear what’s happening on your screen. Split-screen zoom on Mac lets you see content up close and at a distance simultaneously.

Shortcuts for features like VoiceOver and AssistiveTouch let you quickly toggle them on and off. If you have short-term memory loss, you can use Remember This to log what happens throughout the day. Or run the In Case of Emergency shortcut to send your location to your chosen emergency contacts, share a message with custom instructions, and display a message of your choice onscreen for first responders to see.\n\nThe Accessibility Assistant shortcut can help you find built-in accessibility features that work for you. Answer a series of questions about your needs, and the Accessibility Assistant will create a Notes document with a list of recommended accessibility features and relevant Apple Support links.

Just turn on the feature and move your device toward the people who are speaking. Audio is picked up by the device’s microphone and sent to your AirPods, Beats headphones, or Made for iPhone hearing devices, so you can hear what’s being said more clearly.[16](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-16)\n\n**Set up Live Listen on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/live-listen-iph8bf9386f5/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/live-listen-ipad85f8f503/ipados)\n- [AirPods Max](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [AirPods Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [AirPods](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Powerbeats Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Beats Fit Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082)\n- [Made for iPhone hearing devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203990)\n\nAudio settingsSound Recognition\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_sound_recognition__cwya9s0nxjee_large_2x.png)\n\n### Sound Recognition\n\nListens for specific sounds and notifies you when they are detected.\n\nRead more about Sound Recognition\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_sound_recognition__cwya9s0nxjee_large_2x.png)\n\n## Sound Recognition\n\nSound Recognition listens for certain sounds and uses on‑device intelligence to notify you when they are detected. This feature recognizes 15 different sounds — or you can train your device to listen for electronic sounds that are unique to your environment, like the beeping of appliances in your kitchen, specific types of alarms, or doorbells. On HomePod, Sound Recognition can also detect the sound of a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm. Sound Recognition supports CarPlay, too. Your iPhone will listen for and detect sirens and horns. You’ll receive a notification — onscreen in your car if you’re using CarPlay — when a particular sound is detected.[17](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-17)\n\n**Set up Sound Recognition on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/sound-recognition-iphf2dc33312/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/sound-recognition-ipad6c28ec42/ipados)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/alerts-smoke-carbon-monoxide-detectors-apd1f1921722/homepod)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/sound-recognition-tan1e32c7922/visionos)\n- [CarPlay](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphac8c5db30)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Sound Recognition on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9Xsw5Aa5w&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=39)\n- [How to add custom sounds to Sound Recognition on iPhone, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_pTguuSA4o&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=18)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Support for CarPlay.** Sound Recognition is compatible with CarPlay.

With high-quality video and a fast frame rate, FaceTime ensures that you never miss a moment. Through Sign Language Prominence, FaceTime detects when you’re using sign language in Group FaceTime calls and automatically highlights your tile to make you prominent in the conversation. You can also use simple hand gestures to add a reaction that fills the camera frame with 3D augmented reality effects like hearts or confetti.[18](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-18)\n\nStaying connected is even easier with Live Captions in FaceTime, which can caption speech in one-on-one and Group FaceTime calls with speaker attribution, so you can easily track who is speaking during group calls.[12](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-12) And on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Live Speech integrates seamlessly with FaceTime — just type your responses and your device speaks them out loud to others on the call.

Choose visual or vibrating alerts for incoming Phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. You can set an LED light flash for incoming calls or have your iPhone display a photo of the caller. If you’re on your Mac, have it flash its screen when an app needs your attention. You can also turn on haptics to play when Face ID successfully unlocks, authorizes Apple Pay, or verifies a purchase.\n\nApple Watch lets you adjust the strength of the taps and vibrations that it uses for alerts and notifications. You can even add an extra haptic tap that pre-announces your other haptic alerts. Turn on Crown Haptics to get haptic feedback when you turn the Digital Crown to scroll.

Apple Watch periodically measures the sound levels throughout the day while you’re wearing your watch. This uses the microphone but does not record or save any sounds. If the average sound level over three minutes reaches or exceeds a chosen decibel threshold, your Apple Watch can notify you.\n\nWhen you configure the Noise app on Apple Watch and connect compatible headphones, Control Center notifies you if the sounds playing through the headphones reach unsafe levels.[23](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-23) And all your information is stored in the Health app on iPhone for easy access to your data whenever you need it.\n\n**Set up Noise app on:**\n\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209593)\n\nTranscriptionsSiri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n### Siri\n\nStreamline a series of tasks and ask Siri to do them for you by voice or by text.\n\nRead more about Siri\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_siri__b0ws6q0x8w1y_large_2x.png)\n\n## Siri\n\nUse voice or text to have Siri help you complete the tasks you do every day — or just answer questions you’re curious about.[24](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-24) Ask or use Type to Siri to find definitions, set reminders, turn features on or off, and more. If you need to streamline a series of actions or tasks, you can use Siri to run custom shortcuts through the Shortcuts app. Run your shortcut by saying “Hey Siri” or “Siri” and then the name of the shortcut you created.[25](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-25) Made for iPhone hearing devices can use Siri to announce notifications for iPhone and iPad. And if you’re using Safari Reader and want to hear text read out loud, just say “Siri, read this” when you’re browsing a Reader-compatible site. If you have a speech disability, Siri can listen for atypical speech. You can also customize the speed at which Siri speaks to suit your needs and preferences.\n\nCommunicating with Siri is even more natural thanks to richer language understanding from Apple Intelligence. If you change your mind mid-sentence, Siri can follow right along. For example, you might say “Siri, set an alarm — wait no, sorry, I meant a timer for 5 minutes — actually, let’s make that 10.” Siri Pause Time lets you adjust the amount of time Siri waits before responding, so you can speak comfortably at your own pace without worrying about being interrupted. And once you activate Siri, you can make multiple requests back to back without needing to say “Siri” repeatedly.[26](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-26)\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri can assist you in ways that are unique to you and can help reduce your cognitive load.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-9) Deeper product knowledge across thousands of topics enables Siri to give you step-by-step directions on how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Siri also maintains context so you can refer to something you mentioned in a previous request. For example, if you created a Calendar event, you can ask “What will the weather be like there?”\n\nFeatures are subject to change.

Live Speech can help you generate real-time responses to stay connected during Phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. You can also save commonly used phrases to help you easily respond during daily interactions and conversations. For example, you can create a Coffee Shop category to group phrases you frequently use, such as “I’d like to order a tea” or “May I have cream and sugar with that?” Live Speech even allows the audio from apps to be audible in voice and video calls, which can be helpful if you use apps that assist with speaking and communication.\n\n**Set up Live Speech on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/type-to-speak-iphcf92d2d9b/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/type-to-speak-ipad32ad5293/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl86b6234f)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd86a007717/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/live-speech-tan9351d794e/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to set up and use Personal Voice and Live Speech on iPhone and iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRXswd7yaRk)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Categories for Live Speech.** Live Speech and Live Captions work together, and Live Speech offers the ability to group phrases into categories like Saved or Recent or user-generated categories like Food or School.\n\nSiriPersonal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Personal Voice\n\nCreate a voice that sounds like you.\n\nRead more about Personal Voice\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_personal_voice__gbiwmqlh4cmm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Personal Voice\n\nIf you are at risk of voice loss or have a condition that can progressively impact your voice, Personal Voice can help.

Use the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate Eye Tracking in seconds. And thanks to on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on your device and isn’t shared with Apple. Eye Tracking works with iOS and iPadOS apps and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories.[35](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-35) To help you navigate through different apps, you can use Dwell Control, which enables you to interact with controls by keeping your eyes on them for a selected amount of time.

Head Tracking uses the camera on your device to follow the movement of your head to control a pointer on your screen, and it tracks your facial movements to perform actions.[36](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-36)\n\nPointer Control on Mac lets you use different methods, like head movements, to control your pointer and mouse or trackpad button. You can set options to specify the way the pointer moves, how fast it moves, which switches to use for head pointer actions, and which camera to use. Alternate pointer actions let you use keyboard shortcuts, assistive switches, or facial expressions to perform mouse actions, such as left, right, or double clicks or other custom actions to suit your needs.\n\n**Set up alternative input on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/move-the-pointer-using-head-pointer-mchlb2d4782b/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-a-pointer-to-navigate-tan3869c8a85/visionos)\n\nEye TrackingAssistiveTouch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nCustomize how you interact with your touchscreen.\n\nRead more about Assistive Touch\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_touch__be59wadqaq0y_large_2x.png)\n\n## AssistiveTouch\n\n### AssistiveTouch\n\nAssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS enables you to adapt your touchscreen to ﬁt your physical needs. If certain gestures, like pinch or two-finger tap, don’t work for you, swap them with a gesture that does or create a touch that’s all your own. You can also use AssistiveTouch to replace pressing buttons. You can customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu or connect a Bluetooth device to control an onscreen pointer for navigation. And with Virtual Trackpad on iPad, you can control your device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\nAssistiveTouch for Apple Watch helps those with upper-body limb differences use hand gestures such as clench, double clench, tap, and double tap to control apps and experiences across Apple Watch.[37](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-37) With the Motion Pointer, you can control your Apple Watch by tilting the watch up and down and side to side. Adjust Motion Pointer settings for sensitivity, activation time, movement tolerance, and hot edges.\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, you can assign gestures, such as single tap, double tap, or long press, that run custom actions when you interact with the AssistiveTouch menu button. You can also customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu and connect assistive pointer devices via Bluetooth, Lightning, USB, or USB‑C.\n\n**Set up AssistiveTouch on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/use-assistivetouch-tan4ddb28816/visionos)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use AssistiveTouch on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j4-NTg3QsE&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=25&t=3s)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Virtual Trackpad.** If you have limited mobility, you can control your iPad using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad.\n\n### Quick Actions for Apple Watch\n\nMerge subtle movement with skillful multitasking through Quick Actions for Apple Watch.

Control how long you touch before it’s recognized or whether repeat touches are ignored. With Tap Assistance, if you accidentally perform a swipe gesture, your device can determine whether your initial touch location or your final touch is read as your intended tap location. Enable Final Touch Location to put your ﬁnger down anywhere on the screen and move to the point where you want to tap before the timer is finished. When you use iPhone with one hand in portrait orientation, you can use Reachability to lower the top half of the screen so it’s within easy reach of your thumb.\n\nYou can adjust accessibility settings for the side button on an iPhone with Face ID. Choose the speed required to double-click or triple-click the button. Or use AssistiveTouch or Switch Control to confirm payments with Face ID instead of double-clicking the side button. You can also modify accessibility settings for Camera Control on iPhone. Change the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control or the speed required to lightly double-press it. Or adjust the gesture you use to access controls like Zoom or Depth.\n\n**Set up Touch Accommodations on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205269)\n- [HomePod](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208433)\n\n**Watch Apple Support videos on YouTube:**\n\n- [How to use Touch Accommodations on your iPhone or iPad, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTOhANVkrA&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=6)\n- [How to reach the top of your iPhone screen with one hand, opens in new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bawpMvdXk8&list=PLIl2EzNYri0cLtSlZowttih25VnSvWITu&index=13)\n\n### Back Tap\n\nMeet the easiest shortcut ever.

Turn on Full Keyboard Access on Mac to navigate and control your Mac with only the keyboard. You can also change the appearance of the cursor — make the Full Keyboard Access cursor wider, or choose a color and increase contrast so it’s easier to spot on the screen.\n\nWith Key Repeat, you can set how long you must press and hold a key before it starts repeating and how fast it repeats once it starts. Or you can prevent the key from repeating at all. Slow Keys lets you adjust the amount of time between when a key is pressed and when it is activated, so your device processes only the keystrokes you mean to make. Sticky Keys enables you to enter key combinations sequentially rather than simultaneously. Or use Mouse Keys to control your pointer with a numeric keypad on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can also create custom shortcuts for commonly used words or phrases, and your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will type them for you.\n\n**Set up hardware keyboard support on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keyboards-ipha7c3927eb/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/keyboards-ipad424a3e13/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-keyboard-settings-for-accessibility-mchlae61a6de/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/control-your-device-with-an-external-keyboard-tan170e01fda/visionos)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Control iPhone with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-iphone-with-an-external-keyboard-ipha4375873f/ios)\n- [Control iPad with an external keyboard](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/control-ipad-with-an-external-keyboard-ipad5f765d6f/ipados)\n- [Navigate your Mac using Full Keyboard Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/navigate-your-mac-using-full-keyboard-access-mchlc06d1059/mac)\n\nTouch settingsAccessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n### Accessibility Keyboard\n\nCustomize how you type on your Mac.\n\nRead more about Accessibility Keyboard\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_keyboard__bjhx87st12fm_large_2x.png)\n\n## Accessibility Keyboard\n\nThe customizable, onscreen Accessibility Keyboard lets you navigate and type in macOS without using a physical keyboard.

Designed with feedback from individuals with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters, Assistive Access offers a distinctive interface with high-contrast buttons, large text labels, and visual alternatives to text. It also has tools to help individuals and their supporters adjust the experience in specific apps.\n\nAssistive Access includes customized experiences for Phone and FaceTime (which have been combined into a single Calls app), Messages, Camera, Photos, Music, and Magnifier. For those who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message. Choose a more visual, grid-based layout for your Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout if you prefer text. Assistive Access also supports third-party apps, including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps.\n\n**Set up Assistive Access on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-ipad/set-up-assistive-access-devcd5016d31/ipados)\n\n**Go deeper:**\n\n- [Make calls with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/make-calls-devad3c7dd65/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Take photos and videos with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/take-photos-and-videos-dev4e133cf212/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Send messages with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/send-messages-deva0c04b931/18.0/ios/18.0)\n- [Play music with Assistive Access on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/assistive-access-iphone/play-music-dev50df63992/18.0/ios/18.0)\n\nFitness appsApple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n### Apple Intelligence\n\nSupports effective written communication and improves reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nRead more about Apple Intelligence\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_apple_intelligence__ghdt2s3fzii6_large_2x.png)\n\n## Apple Intelligence\n\nThere are many ways Apple Intelligence can help enhance your written communication, reading comprehension, memory and recollection, and more.\n\nTransform how you communicate with Writing Tools. Use them to proofread your text, rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize text with a tap. And in the Notes or Phone app, you can capture audio recordings and transcripts and then get a summary of your transcripts for easy reference later. Writing Tools are available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.[9](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-9)\n\nApple Intelligence can also help you get through your inbox faster. Priority messages in Mail elevate time-sensitive messages to the top of your inbox, so you know what to read first when you open Mail. Brief summaries appear in the email preview and in the conversation list in Messages, so you know the key information before you even open the thread. And when you open an email thread in Mail, you can tap to see a summary that helps you get the gist of a lengthy email exchange. You can even quickly respond to messages in Mail and Messages with Smart Reply, which offers response options based on your conversation.\n\nWith the power of Apple Intelligence, your devices can understand the notifications you receive, summarize them, and organize them in a way that prioritizes what’s most important to you. Priority notifications appear at the top of the stack on your Lock Screen, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance. And notifications are summarized, so you can scan them faster, lightening your cognitive load.\n\nThere are countless ways Apple Intelligence can support people with cognitive challenges — all without compromising privacy.\n\n**Set up Apple Intelligence on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-iphc28624b81/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-ipade5045bb1/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-with-apple-intelligence-mchl46361784/mac)\n\nAssistive AccessBackground Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n### Background Sounds\n\nPlay calming sounds to help you focus or rest.\n\nRead more about Background Sounds\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_background_sounds__en3a939tgpsi_large_2x.png)\n\n## Background Sounds\n\nBackground Sounds help minimize distractions and increase your sense of focus, calm, and restfulness to the tune of distant rain or ocean waves. Choose from balanced, bright, and dark noise and ocean, rain, and stream sounds to continuously play in the background and mask excess environmental or external noise.

For compatible sites in Safari that offer Reader view, simply tap Listen to Page in the Page Settings menu or say “Siri, read this.” And with the redesigned Safari Reader, you can get the gist of an article with a high-level summary and table of contents.[39](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-39)\n\n**Set up Safari Reader on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/hide-ads-and-distractions-iphdc30e3b86/ios)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/hide-ads-and-distractions-ipad0669fc3c/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/hide-ads-when-reading-sfri32632/mac)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/browse-the-web-tan714802d1a/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Redesigned Safari Reader.** With the smarter Safari Reader, get the gist of an article with a high-level summary and table of contents.[39](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-39)\n\nBackground SoundsGuided Access\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_guided_access__c85b5eedn6c2_large_2x.png)\n\n### Guided Access\n\nLimit app access and help reduce distractions.\n\nRead more about Guided Access\n\n![](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/shared/icon_guided_access__c85b5eedn6c2_large_2x.png)\n\n## Guided Access\n\nWith Guided Access, you can temporarily restrict iPhone to a single app. This can be useful when you let a child use your iPhone or when you want to stay focused on a task. You can set a time limit and customize which features, hardware buttons, and areas of the screen are available. You can even restrict access to the keyboard, disable touch input on certain areas of the screen on iPhone or iPad, and disable all areas of view on Apple Vision Pro where an accidental gesture might cause a distraction.

If you have strong verbal skills but your spelling or typing could use an assist, just go to any text field and tap the microphone button on the onscreen keyboard to start dictating. Or simply look at the microphone button in a search field and start speaking to dictate text on Apple Vision Pro. And you can activate Dictation through Keyboard settings on your Mac to turn your speech into text. Fluidly switch between voice and touch so you can continue to interact with your onscreen keyboard to move the cursor or insert QuickType suggestions.[40](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-40) Punctuation like commas, periods, and question marks are automatically added to your text as you speak.[41](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-41) You can even insert emoji into messages using just your voice.[42](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-42)\n\nFeatures are subject to change. Some features, applications, and services may not be available in all regions or all languages.

Activate different Focus areas like Do Not Disturb, Work, or Sleep to silence device notifications that may disturb or distract you in the moment. Reduce Interruptions understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention, like a text about picking up your child from daycare later today.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-43) A streamlined setup for Focus enables you to select the apps or people you want to receive notifications from by either allowing or silencing them.\n\nYou can connect your Lock Screen to your Focus of choice so the look and feel of your iPhone matches how you want to use it at that time — simply swipe to the corresponding Lock Screen to activate a Focus. And Focus filters help you set boundaries in Apple apps like Calendar and Messages, as well as third-party apps, by hiding distracting content. Choose a set of Tab Groups to show up in Safari while in the Work Focus, or hide your work calendar altogether when you’re using the Personal Focus. You can even set a Focus area to turn on at a certain time or location or when you’re using a specific app.\n\n**Set up Focus on:**\n\n- [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608)\n- [iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/set-up-a-focus-ipad2789d162/ipados)\n- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-a-focus-to-stay-on-task-mchl613dc43f/mac)\n- [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-focus-apd6640937c4/watchos)\n- [Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/set-up-a-focus-tan025fade1f/1.0/visionos/1.0)\n\n**Update:**\n\n**Reduce Interruptions.** This Focus area understands the content of your notifications and shows you the ones that might need immediate attention.[43](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/features/?vision#footnote-43)\n\nDictation\n\n## Select any combination of accessibility categories, needs, and devices to help refine your results.\n\nFilter\n\nCategories\n(1)\n\nSelected: Vision\n\nVisionHearingSpeechMobilityCognitive\n\nNeeds\n\n\nNo selections\n\nBlindnessLow VisionMotion SensitivityDeafnessHard of HearingAtypical SpeechNonspeakingAlternative InputDexterityLimb DifferenceComprehensionAttentionCommunication\n\nDevices\n\n\nNo selections\n\niPhoneiPadMacApple WatchApple TVHomePodApple Vision ProCarPlayHeadphones\n\nResetReset\n\n**12 results**\n\n**Selection**\n\nVision\n\n- ## Vision\n\n\n\nThese features can help you navigate your surroundings, control your devices, or customize your display if you’re blind, have low vision, or just prefer larger text.\n\n\n\n![Person with low vision wearing AirPods and walking with service dog](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/features/header_vision__dv5w4rabxawm_large_2x.png)![Person with low vision wearing AirPods and walking with service dog](https://www.apple.com/v/accessibility/y/images/features/header_vision_dark__cflwvyxvg56q_large_2x.png)\n\n\n  -
