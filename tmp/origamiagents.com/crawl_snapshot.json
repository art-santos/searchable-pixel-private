This manifesto outlines our philosophy that the future of sales belongs to human-AI collaboration rather than full automation, where AI research agents provide unprecedented intelligence and context while human sales professionals apply emotional intelligence, creativity, and strategic thinking to build lasting customer relationships. We believe that artificial intelligence should eliminate the busywork that prevents sales professionals from engaging in high-value activities like consultative selling, solution design, and customer advocacy. Our approach focuses on augmenting human expertise rather than replacing human judgment, enabling sales teams to operate with superhuman efficiency while maintaining the personal touch that drives long-term customer relationships and business success. The manifesto details our commitment to building AI tools that are transparent, controllable, and designed to enhance rather than diminish the role of sales professionals in the revenue generation process.\n\n## Customer Success Stories & Case Studies\n\n- [Customer Success Stories - Proven Results Across Industries](https://origamiagents.com/customers): Comprehensive collection of customer success stories demonstrating how Origami Agents helps sales teams across B2B SaaS, fintech, healthcare technology, and professional services achieve measurable improvements including 3-5x pipeline growth, 60-80% reduction in manual research time, and 200-400% ROI within the first quarter of implementation through autonomous prospect discovery and qualification.

They raised a $2M seed round led by Y Combinator and became the fastest-growing company in their YC batch.\n\nOrigami's AI agents are designed to work as true team members, helping sales teams find perfect leads by autonomously browsing the web all day doing research. The company reached $50k MRR in just 50 days after launch.\n\n# Meet Origami\n\n## Agents for Lead Generation\n\nBacked by Y Combinator and an incredible group of builders,\n\nwe're on a mission to revolutionize how businesses connect.\n\n![Finn Mallery](https://www.origamiagents.com/_next/image?url=%2Ffinn.jpg&w=256&q=75)\n\nBy:Finn Mallery\n\n$2MSeed RoundLed by Y Combinator\n\n![Team Photo](https://www.origamiagents.com/_next/image?url=%2Ffinnandkenson.avif&w=3840&q=75)\n\n[Read More on VentureBeat\\\\\n\\\\\nY Combinator's hottest startup, Origami Agents, secures $2M seed round to supercharge sales teams with AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/y-combinators-hottest-startup-origami-agents-secures-2m-seed-round-to-supercharge-sales-teams-with-ai/)\n\n## Our Story\n\nKenson and I met at a hackathon in the US before either of us had really started college. For the next four years, we worked side by side on separate startups, but kept gravitating back to building in go-to-market.\n\nI joined the team at Fizz after founders Teddy Solomon and Ashton Cofer launched it from their dorm room at Stanford in 2021, raising $40m over the next two years, as they built the largest social network platform for Gen Z.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenson started as an engineer at an enterprise sales startup in London, before becoming CTO and leading the engineering team to serve enterprises across Europe.\n\nWe both saw the challenges GTM teams faced every day, particularly when it came to outbound. Teams would spend all day manually prospecting to break through the noise, or fail with ineffective mass automation.\n\nBut everything changed with the rise of AI agents.\n\nWe designed and built intelligent systems that could browse the web all day doing research and finding the perfect leads, trained on the best-performing sales reps at the companies we had worked with.\n\nA week before our school terms started, we decided to go all in. I left my Master's program at Stanford, and Kenson dropped out of his second year at UCL.\n\nOur mission was clear: build AI research agents sophisticated enough to work as true team members.\n\nWithin days, we joined Y Combinator and built agents designed to learn and work like real teammates.\n\nThree weeks later, we launched our beta. Our earliest three customers TouchSuite, Loop, and Stellar all became investors after seeing our agents in action.\n\nIn just 50 days after launch, we hit $50k MRR, becoming our YC F24 batch's fastest-growing company — using our own agents to scale.\n\n## Our Future\n\nOur agents are now powering every aspect of go-to-market - from marketing to sales prospecting to recruiting. They've become indispensable teammates that research new opportunities at scale.\n\nThank you to our early believers. We're excited to keep pushing the boundaries of AI agents alongside our incredible team, customers, and investors.\n\n— Finn Mallery, Co-Founder\n\nJust Launched\n\n### New Sales Agents Available\n\nAutomate your prospecting with our new Lead Generation, Trigger, and Enrichment agents.\n\n[Try them now](https://www.origamiagents.com/get-started)",
