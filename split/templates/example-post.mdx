# Getting Started with Split: AI-Powered Content Delivery

Welcome to Split! This is an example of the content that Split's AI agent will deliver to your Next.js website.

## What is Split?

Split is an AI-powered content delivery system that connects to your static site and acts as a remote publishing agent for SEO and AEO (AI Engine Optimization) content.

## How It Works

1. **Configure your content strategy** in the Split dashboard
2. **Split generates optimized content** using state-of-the-art AI
3. **Content is delivered** directly to your site via the webhook you just installed
4. **Your site is indexed** by search engines and LLMs like ChatGPT and Perplexity

## Benefits of AI-Powered Content

- **SEO Optimized**: Content is crafted to rank well in traditional search engines
- **AEO Ready**: Structured for maximum visibility in AI systems like ChatGPT
- **Always Fresh**: Regular updates keep your content relevant
- **Zero Effort**: Content is researched, written, and published automatically

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component to display Split content:

```jsx
export function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div className="metadata">
        <time>{formatDate(post.date)}</time>
        <span>By {post.author}</span>
      </div>
      <div className="content">{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```
