== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do AI crawlers execute JavaScript? =

No, AI crawlers like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity typically don't execute JavaScript. That's why Split Analytics uses server-side tracking to capture these visits that traditional analytics tools miss.

= Is this plugin GDPR compliant? =

Yes! Split Analytics only tracks AI crawlers (bots), not human visitors. No personal data is collected, making it GDPR compliant by design.

= Does this slow down my website? =

No. The plugin is designed to be lightweight with zero dependencies. Tracking happens server-side and doesn't impact page load times for your visitors.

= What's the difference between free and paid plans? =

The plugin is free to use. Split Analytics offers paid plans for advanced features like longer data retention, detailed analytics, and API access. Check [split.dev](https://split.dev) for current pricing.

= Can I track crawlers without the Split Analytics service? =

The plugin stores crawler visits locally in your WordPress database, so you can see basic activity in your WordPress admin. However, the full analytics dashboard and advanced features require a Split Analytics account.

= How accurate is crawler detection? =

Very accurate! We maintain an extensive database of 30+ AI crawler user agents and update it regularly. The plugin also includes fallback detection for unknown AI crawlers.

= Can I exclude certain pages from tracking? =

Yes! You can use regex patterns to exclude specific paths (like admin pages) or include only certain paths (like blog posts) in the advanced settings.

= Does this work with caching plugins? =

Yes! Since tracking happens at the server level before caching, it works with all popular caching plugins including WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, and WP Super Cache.
